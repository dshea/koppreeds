    <strong>MAKING REEDS</strong> can be a quicksand of poorly 
          invested time from which a bassoonist struggles to emerge. Alternatively, 
          reed making can be a stepping stone toward more expressive playing and 
          increased confidence. <strong>James Kopp &amp; Associates</strong>, 
          a firm of reed makers for bassoon, contrabassoon, and early bassoon 
          since 1991, offers in-depth answers about reeds and reed making in the 
          form of consultations, lessons, and master classes. Past clients include 
          established professionals in New York-area symphonic, operatic, theater, 
          and early-music ensembles, and amateur and student players at many levels 
          of experience.

    Reed making lessons follow an established syllabus and 
          method. A full course consists of fourteen hours of lessons, broken 
          into two-hour segments. These are taken in reverse order of the construction 
          process, so that the student&#8217;s lessons begin to pay off immediately:
    <p>1. Final Adjustments<br>
          2. Finishing techniques <br>
          3. Blank forming<br>
          4. Profiling and shaping<br>
          5. Pre-gouging and gouging<br>
          6. Cane selection and matching<br>
          7. Reed design: size, proportions, style, feel</p>
    <p>The student can schedule lessons at short or long intervals, 
          as convenient. The number of tools required is minimal in the early 
          lessons, but increases later. We can recommend and provide tools and 
          supplies from Fox Products Inc., or the student can view a <a href="tools.html">listing 
          of tools</a> for individual purchase. </p>

  <div class="w3-container">
    Consultations are problem-solving discussions devoted 
          to matters of personal concern to the bassoonist already experienced 
          in reed making. Issues we have successfully addressed in the past include: 
          adjusting to a new instrument, improving projection, improving response, 
          general or specific tuning concerns, cane quality and selection, improving 
          yield in reed making, adjustments to reed making machines, and extending 
          reed life.

    Master classes are available for schools and other groups 
          of bassoonists. These typically focus on standard reed making procedures 
          (as described above, under Lessons). Alternatively, they may focus on 
          specific questions (as described above, under Consultations). Master 
          classes are often presented in collaboration with a resident or visiting 
          bassoon instructor. Recent classes have included the Juilliard School 
          of Music, New York University, the Royal Academy of Music (London), 
          the University of Iowa, the University of Northern Iowa, and the University 
          of Wisconsin (Madison).

    We make contra reeds in both traditional and innovative 
          styles, and we have probably made more reeds for early bassoons than 
          any other commercial reed maker in the world. Our insights are now available 
          to clients. The present-day player of a historical instrument can obtain 
          excellent results in either of two ways: (1) with modern-style reeds 
          of appropriate dimensions, or (2) with short-scrape designs based on 
          examples from historical sources. Either approach can be adapted to 
          work with baroque-, classical-, or romantic-era bassoons, or with bass 
          dulcian (curtal). Consultations on particular topics or lessons on basic 
          techniques are available.

    has performed with The New Jersey Symphony, Smithsonian Chamber Orchestra,
    American Classical Orchestra,and The Sebastians. His modern reeds have been
    used in the New York Philharmonic and Metropolitan Opera orchestras, among
    many others. His reeds for early bassoon are used in period-instrument
    orchestras throughout North America, Europe, Australia, and Japan. He is the
    author of numerous articles on reeds and reed making in <em>The Grove
    Dictionary of Musical Instruments</em> and <em>The Double Reed.</em> (An
    expanded collection of these articles will appear in book form in the near
    future.) He is also the author of <em>The Bassoon</em>, a history of the
    instrument published by Yale University Press. He earned a Ph.D. in music
    history and theory from the University of Pennsylvania, and studied bassoon
    with Carl Nitchie, Jesse Read, Dennis Godburn, and Chuck Holdeman. He also
    studied contrabassoon with Thomas Sefcovic.
