        readers. Teachers wishing to reprint articles in quantity should contact 
        the author, James B. Kopp, for permission.</p>
      <p><strong><a href="Tube_Tip_and_Aperture_rev3.pdf"><font size="+1">Tube, 
        Tip, and Aperture: The Functional Geometry of your Bassoon Reed</font></a></strong><br>
        The tip-to-tube width ratio of a bassoon reed has a predictable effect 
        on the reed&#8217;s aperture&#8212;the opening at the tip. The aperture 
        in turn determines the basic personality of the reed&#8217;s response. 
        This discussion, reprinted from <em>The Double Reed</em> 36/1 (2013), 
        focuses on the geometric interplay of these elements&#8212;tube, tip, 
        and aperture, together with management tools like wire adjustments and 
        bindings. The text is accompanied by numerous line drawings illustrating 
        geometrical relationships. </p>
      <p><strong><font size="+1"><a href="physicalforces.html">Physical Forces 
        at Work in Bassoon Reeds<br>
        </a></font></strong>Bassoon players and reed makers never cease debating 
        the effects of length, width, shape, profile, gouge and scrape upon the 
        working bassoon reed. This article, reprinted from <em>The Double Reed</em> 
        26/2 (2003), explains how each of these design factors contributes to 
        the reed&#8217;s vibration. Other topics examined include control of the 
        tip aperture (through wire adjustments and otherwise), the four-phase 
        cycle of reed vibration, sources of tension in reed design, and the interaction 
        between embouchure and reed vibration. This theoretical foundation allows 
        reed makers to begin to predict the effects of design changes on reed 
        sound and response. The text is accompanied by numerous line drawings 
        relating reed design to scientific principles of mechanics.</p>
      <p><strong><font size="+1"><a href="virtues.html">Counting the Virtues of 
        Bassoon Reed Cane</a></font></strong><br>
        Bad cane, good cane, old cane, new cane &#8211; reed makers voice so many 
        opinions about <em>Arundo donax</em> (the material of bassoon reeds) that 
        they sometimes seem to hold no beliefs in common. In fact, a good deal 
        of common ground can be found (much of it supported by scientific understanding), 
        once the reader understands certain concepts and terms. This article, 
        reprinted from <em>The Double Reed</em> 26/4 (2003), defines, compares, 
        and contrasts the many varying qualities of cane, including hardness, 
        stiffness, resiliency, density, flexibility, resonant frequency, color, 
        and &#8220;feel under the tool.&#8221; Some disagreement about cane quality 
        is seen to result from the varied reed styles cultivated by individual 
        reed makers. This article also examines the effect of soaking (hydration) 
        upon the reed&#8217;s performance and aging. The text is accompanied by 
        line drawings and photographs.</p>
      <p><font size="+1"><strong><a href="risk.html">Risk Management in Bassoon 
        Reed Making: Three Examples</a></strong></font><br>
        Some reed makers are swash-buckling speed demons, shunning measurements, 
        safeguards, and tedious routine in the heat of the creative moment. Other 
        reed makers show the icy composure of brain surgeons, seeking every precaution 
        against fatal mishaps as they soberly wield their tools. This article, 
        reprinted from <em>The Double Reed</em> 27/4 (2004), will stimluate the 
        thinking of both types. Specific examples -- suggested techniques for 
        cutting the reed collar and narrowing the blades -- show how work habits 
        borrowed from machinists can reduce risk and reveal the true strengths 
        (and weaknesses) of various reed designs. The text is accompanied by color 
        photographs.</p>
      <p><font size="+1"><strong><a href="harmonic.html">The Not-Quite-Harmonic 
        Overblowing of the Bassoon</a></strong></font><br>
        The upper registers of the German-system bassoon are produced by overblowing 
        -- the use of higher vibrational modes of the instrument. In the third 
        and higher modes, the patterns of overblown fingerings are complicated 
        by various factors, including pipe resonances that are not precisely harmonic. 
        In this article, reprinted from <em>The Double Reed</em> 29/2 (2006), 
        this topic is explored, along with the relevance to the bassoon of such 
        acoustical concepts as ancestor fingerings, cross-finger vents, mode shifting, 
        regimes of oscillation, full-system resonances, and overtone compression. 
        Numerous figures of acoustical spectra and bassoon fingerings accompany 
        the text.</p>
