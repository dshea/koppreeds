    <p align="left"> All bassoonists who have ever made reeds agree on a basic 
      difference between &#8220;good&#8221; cane and &#8220;bad&#8221; cane. 
      When two reeds are identical in design, manufacture and condition, the 
      one that responds well is made of &#8220;good&#8221; cane, while the mediocre 
      or worse reed is made of &#8220;bad&#8221; cane. </p>
    <p align="left">Consensus breaks down, sad to say, after that one declaration. 
      Discussing the matter, Player A says he prefers &#8220;older&#8221; cane. 
      B says she doesn&#8217;t care about the age, as long as the cane is &#8220;hard 
      enough.&#8221; C says that he looks for &#8220;cane with a close grain,&#8221; 
      while D says she knows a good piece of cane &#8220;by the color.&#8221; 
      E prefers French cane to all other types, while F prefers cane only from 
      selected &#8220;vintages&#8221; or harvests. Are these reed makers really 
      talking about six different qualities? Is each of these qualities a necessary 
      or sufficient marker of desirable cane? Are still other qualities also 
      important?</p>
    <p align="left">These are reasonable questions to ask, but the answers are 
      far from obvious. Edwin V. Lacy recently offered a useful enumeration 
      of some of the different qualities that may contribute to the vibratory 
      characteristics of reed cane.<a href="#note1"><em><font size="-1">1</font></em></a> 
      His list included &#8220;hardness, stiffness, resiliency, density, flexibility,&#8221; 
      and a quality to be assessed by a &#8220;dynamic&#8221; test. (A physicist 
      would call this last quality &#8220;resonant frequency.&#8221;) Some other 
      bassoonists might have added to Lacy&#8217;s list. Lawrence Intravia identified 
      a quality he called &#8220;recovery.&#8221;<em><a href="#note2"><font size="-1">2</font></a></em> 
      Numerous other authors have mentioned color, straightness of grain, texture, 
      and &#8220;feel under the tool.&#8221;</p>
    <p align="left">Lacy raised a second important idea, that of possible correlation 
      between distinct characteristics. In other words, certain characteristics 
      &#8211; hardness and density, to use Lacy&#8217;s example &#8211; may 
      be conceptually separate, but may tend to occur together in reed cane. 
      A further wrinkle is that two characteristics may both be thought necessary 
      for &#8220;good&#8221; reeds, but not be correlated in the broad supply 
      of available cane. James V. Poe recently made this argument for another 
      pair of characteristics &#8211; hardness and flexibility.<a href="#note3"><font size="-1"><em>3</em></font></a> 
    </p>
    <p align="left">Having in mind this quick overview of the reported virtues 
      of basson reed cane, we can ask two useful questions: (1) Are any of these 
      cited qualities in fact synonyms or antonyms for one another, or are they 
      conceptually distinct? (2) Even if certain qualities of cane may be distinguished 
      from one another in concept, do they nevertheless occur in correlation 
      with one another?</p>
    <p align="left">A third question we might ask concerns the aging of reeds. 
      Even a good reed changes with age, eventually reaching a point where its 
      response is no longer &#8220;good&#8221; or dependable. It is reasonable 
      to ask: (3) What changes come about as reeds age, and are these changes 
      related to the qualities that distinguish &#8220;good&#8221; new reeds 
      from &#8220;bad&#8221; new reeds? </p>
    <p align="left">In seeking to answer these questions, we can draw on the 
      observations of three kinds of experts. The first group will be scientists 
      &#8211; botanists, chemists, and physicists &#8211; who have commented 
      on the unique vibratory characteristics of Arundo donax, its water-absorbing 
      ability, the anatomical differences between desirable and undesirable 
      cane, etc. The second group will be cane growers, both commercial and 
      individual, who have provided details about the agriculture, harvesting, 
      and curing of the cane. Having this background, we will be well prepared 
      to review the qualities that bassoonists, our third group, have cited 
      as desirable in a &#8220;good&#8221; piece of Arundo donax.</p>
    <p align="left">The following account has been narrowly tailored to include 
      only answers to the questions asked above. For further details of scientific 
      knowledge, agricultural practices, or reed makers&#8217; wisdom, the reader 
      should refer to the sources cited here, among others. </p>
    <p align="left"><a name="section1"></a><strong><font size="+1">1. The Anatomy 
      of Arundo Donax</font></strong></p>
    <p align="left">One fundamental requirement of a bassoon reed is that it 
      have both a tube and blades, which is less simple than it sounds. Among 
      naturally occurring and easily workable materials, it is surprisingly 
      rare to find a substance that can provide both features. Until modern 
      times, it seems, only cane &#8211; with its composite structure &#8211; 
      had the necessary strength to form a stable tube, coupled with the necessary 
      flexibility, when scraped, to readily form a bassoon reed.<a href="#note4"><font size="-1"><em>4</em></font></a> 
    </p>
    <p align="left">A team led by the botanist Peter Kolesik described the composition 
      of a stem of Arundo donax as comprising three concentric rings: (1) a 
      hard waxy epidermis and outer cortical cells, (2) a thick sclerified fiber 
      band, and (3) a thick inner cortex.<a href="#note5"><font size="-1"><em>5</em></font></a> 
      <br>
    </p>
    <p align="center"><img id="figA" src="images/FigA.jpg"></p>
    <p align="center"><em><font size="-1">Microphotograph of cross section of

      (1) epidermal cell, (4) large, thin-walled parenchyma cell [ground tissue]

      bundle in inner cortex, (8) ring of lignified cells surrounding vascular 
      bundle. Photograph courtesy of Marilyn S. Veselack.</font></em> </p>
    <p align="left">Bassoonists often call the first of these the &#8220;rind&#8221; 
      or &#8220;bark,&#8221; and the third the &#8220;pith.&#8221; In between, 
      the second (the fiber band) is often recognizable as a thin brownish ring. 
      (In the language of botanists, &#8220;sclerified&#8221; means &#8220;hardened&#8221;; 
      &#8220;sclerenchyma&#8221; cells are hardened, or supporting tissue; &#8220;parenchyma&#8221; 
      are softer tissue.) The strength of the two outer rings allows the reed 
      maker to form a stable tube for the bassoon reed. On the blades of the 
      reed, these layers are profiled or scraped away to expose cells of the 
      inner cortex, which are flexible enough to vibrate easily. </p>
    <p align="left">The middle and inner layers include bundles of vessels that 
      supply food and water from the roots to the stem.<a href="#note6"><font size="-1"><em>6</em></font></a> 
      Donald J. Casadonte, a chemist and clarinetist, provided a useful analogy, 
      comparing the dermal tissues to an animal&#8217;s skin, the parenchyma 
      or ground tissues to muscle and/or bone, and the vascular to vein tissue.<a href="#note7"><font size="-1"><em>7</em></font></a> 
      He also explained that sclerenchyma cells begin as vascular cells, but 
      at a later point develop thicker walls, so that they then serve as a load-bearing 
      tube.<a href="#note8"><font size="-1"><em>8</em></font></a> The vascular 
      tissue of the inner cortex is important because the sheathing of the vascular 
      bundles, when of sufficient age and development, contains fiber that gives 
      a very unusual stiffness that allows vibration in all planes. Numerous 
      researchers have identified the inner cortex as the source of these favorable 
      characteristics. Kolesik et al. found that of anatomical characteristics 
      that measurably affect the performance characteristics of clarinet reeds, 
      all &#8220;are attributed to &#8230; the vascular bundles in the inner 
      cortex&#8230;. The good reed &#8230; had vascular bundles with a higher 
      proportion of fiber and lower proportions of xylem and phloem&#8230;. 
      [T]he good reed had a larger fiber area, and a higher proportion of vascular 
      bundles with a continuous fiber ring&#8230;.&#8221;<em><a href="#note9"><font size="-1">9</font></a></em> 
      The findings of Kolesik&#8217;s team corresponded to results obtained 
      by Marilyn Veselack, Jean-Marie Heinrich, and a team led by H.C. Spatz.<a href="#note10"><font size="-1"><em>10</em></font></a>

    <p align="left">Casadonte explained three essential virtues of Arundo donax. 
      First, &#8220;moderate density combined with a high modulus makes Arundo 
      donax unique as a reed material.&#8221;<em><a href="#note11"><font size="-1">11</font></a></em> 
      The &#8220;modulus&#8221; to which he refers is a physical measure of 
      the stiffness of solid materials; a higher modulus indicates greater stiffness. 
      In the instance of Arundo donax, the stiffness results from the high proportion 
      of fiber that Kolesik et al. described.</p>
    <p align="left">A second characteristic of Arundo donax that Casadonte identified 
      is of great significance to bassoon players: &#8220;In true woods there 
      is only one naturally dominant plane of material strength, but in Arundo 
      donax, three planes are of equal strength.&#8221;<em><a href="#note12"><font size="-1">12</font></a></em> 
      In bassoon reeds, the fibers at the back rail of the blades have been 
      rotated (during the forming process) almost 90 degrees away from those 
      at the center of the back. Meanwhile, fibers at the tip have been rotated 
      in the opposite direction, though to a lesser degree. <br>

    </div>    
    
    <p align="left">Without equal flexibility in each plane of vibration, the 
      vibration would be much less predictable, especially in higher modes of 
      vibration (that is, overblown pitches). Even if it could be successfully 
      formed, a wooden reed, with flexibility only along its longitudinal plane, 
      might vibrate chaotically, if at all. </p>
    <p align="left">This remarkable flexibility in all planes is only possible 
      because the fiber cells are largely lignin. Lignin has viscous characteristics 
      of vibration; that is, it vibrates more like a fluid than like a solid. 
      This will come as a surprise to the layman, because lignin is also the 
      source of the hardening or sclerification of cell walls over time. In 
      a typical reed for the modern, German-system bassoon, the lignin is present 
      mostly in the sheathing of the vascular bundles of the inner cortex. (On 
      short-scrape reeds, including some reeds for early bassoon and many oboe 
      reeds, there is a second source of lignin in the fiber ring. This middle 
      layer is not removed from such reeds.) </p>
    <p align="left">The viscous characteristics of lignin are such an essential 
      feature of the bassoon reed that we should hear more of Casadonte&#8217;s 
      explanation: </p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
        last major chemical component (20% to 40%) of Arundo donax is lignin 
        (from the Latin word for wood). This highly complex gummy filler substance 
        is formed from dead plant cells, and usually occurs as a result of the 
        aging process of plants. Lignin protects older plants from pathogens 
        and water, stabilizes the cell wall matrix, and gives viscous shock 
        protection and some plasticity to the plant&#8230;. [T]he presence of 
        the rather amorphous lignin in the relatively flexible cell wall structure 
        of Arundo donax may be responsible for changing the plant stem from 
        one in which there is only one naturally dominant plane of material 
        strength (a situation common in true woods) into one in which each of 
        the x, y, and z planes are of equal strength</font>.<a href="#note13"><font size="-1"><em>13</em></font></a></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left">Arundo donax has the remarkable physical trait of being 
      visco-elastic; that is, it has vibrational characteristics typical of 
      both liquids and solids. Whereas lignin has viscous characteristics, the 
      walls of parenchyma cells have elastic characteristics, and the vascular 
      cells themselves have characteristics somewhere between viscous and elastic.<a href="#note14"><font size="-1"><em>14</em></font></a> 
    </p>
    <p align="left">Casadonte identified a third physical virtue of Arundo donax: 
      when made into reeds for musical instruments, it damps quickly. That is, 
      the vibrations caused by an applied force tend to end quickly, when compared 
      to wood. (This might at first seem to be a drawback, since vibration is 
      the essence of musical sound. But in practice, the force [the standing 
      wave, or vibrating air column] is applied continuously, so that the sound 
      is sustained as long as the player wishes.) The faster the reed damps, 
      the better control the player has over the vibration, avoiding &#8220;destructive 
      interference from cycle to cycle.&#8221;<em><a href="#note15"><font size="-1">15</font></a></em> 
      The damping characteristics are a property of the ground tissue of the 
      inner cortex. (The inner cortex also contains hemicellulose, which absorbs 
      water when a reed is soaked. This important characteristic is discussed 
      below.)</p>

      of Arundo Donax</font></strong></p>
    <p align="left">Several aspects of the growing and harvesting of Arundo 
      donax have been claimed to affect reed quality. The climate, soil, spacing, 
      irrigation, and fertilization are significant, as is the age of the stem 
      at harvest and the timing of the harvest during a suitable cold month. 
      Arundo donax sprouts twice within a calendar year, with only the earlier 
      growth being suitable for reed making, as Dominic Weir explained:</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&#8220;Male&#8221; 
        cane starts growing in the spring &#8211; it is hard, nonporous, and 
        is the best cane for reed making. The &#8220;female&#8221; cane starts 
        to grow later, in July &#8211; it is soft and porous, thus it is inferior 
        to the &#8220;male&#8221; cane. The reason for the &#8220;female&#8217;s&#8221; 
        inferiority is due to its rapid growth, which results in a coarser wood 
        and is less resistant to winter frosts. The distance between the joints 
        is longer.</font><em><a href="#note16"><font size="-1">16</font></a></em> 
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left">Bate made a related point, implying that reed cane should 
      not grow too fast. He emphasized that the climate in southeastern France, 
      the traditional source of cane for reed making, encourages slower growth: 
      &#8220;The art of growing cane for reed making seems to lie in harvesting 
      the plant at the right degree of immaturity, and the Var climate, constantly 
      sunny, yet tempered by the dry and cold mistral, contributes to this very 
      markedly.&#8221;<a href="#note17"><font size="-1"><em>17</em></font></a> 
    </p>
    <p align="left">The proper maturity is two years&#8217; growth, according 
      to Daniele Glotin, director of a prominent cane distribution company.<a href="#note18"><font size="-1"><em>18</em></font></a> 
      Glotin&#8217;s firm owns both planted and wild crops; she noted that controlled 
      planting is slow and expensive, but allows for better access (so that 
      culling is easier, leading to better light for the remaining plants) and 
      controlled irrigation, so that accidents of nature do not damage the crop. 
    </p>
    <p align="left">Soil, light, rainfall, and temperature comprise an environmental 
      system that French winegrowers refer to as terroir. Aspects of the climate 
      may vary somewhat from year to year, but they do so within limits indigenous 
      to the terroir. Terroir is likewise important in the growing of Arundo 
      donax, to the extent that the Glotin firm can produce oboe cane in some 
      fields and larger cane (for bassoon, clarinet, etc.) in others, simply 
      because the two terroirs are significantly different. </p>
    <p align="left">Scientists have given two important reasons why the cane 
      stem needs to reach a certain stage of development before harvest. One 
      is that lignin, which gives cane the desired stiffness for vibration, 
      develops only over time. &#8220;Stems in a more mature state of development 
      have more parenchyma cells with very thick walls. Fiber [lignin] cells 
      also develop extremely thick walls with age&#8230;. As the Arundo stem 
      grows older, the thickness of the cell walls increases.&#8221;<em><a href="#note19"><font size="-1">19</font></a></em> 
      Even within a single plant, the older portions have dramatically more 
      lignin than younger portions: &#8220;Joseleau et al. found, as to be expected, 
      that there is also a correlation between age and lignin concentration. 
      The concentration of lignin increases about ten-fold as one goes from 
      the top (younger portion) of the stem to the bottom (older portion).&#8221;<em><a href="#note20"><font size="-1">20</font></a></em> 
    </p>
    <p align="left">A second factor dependent on age is the concentration of 
      hemicellulose, which stores water when a reed is soaked. (The primary 
      hemicellulose, arabino-4-O-methyl glucuronoxylan, is abbreviated as AMGX.) 
      &#8220;[L]ater harvesting of Arundo donax leads to stable concentrations 
      of AMGX in the plant stem (about 25%). Alternately, younger stems, sectioned 
      only near the base of the plant, show the same trend [toward stable concentrations].&#8221;<em><a href="#note21"><font size="-1">21</font></a></em> 
      Underdeveloped sections may have too much AMGX, leading to excessive water 
      absorption by the reed.</p>
    <p align="left">It&#8217;s also possible for cane, especially if found growing 
      in the wild, to be too old for optimal reed making. John W. Reid wrote 
      that &#8220;cane that has aged in the weather for a long time loses the 
      characteristics of good cane.&#8221; Cane older than two years will tend 
      to have more lignin in the fiber ring and vascular bundle sheathing, which 
      some makers might find advantageous, but others might not.</p>
    <p align="left">Even if a wild crop receives (atypically) the advantages 
      of plantation-like spacing and controlled age, the wild crop may produce 
      a lower yield of desirable cane. In the study by Kolesik et al., musicians 
      and scientists compared two different growths from Australia. Both a windbreak 
      and a plantation crop intended for clarinet reeds were planted with similar 
      spacing. The clarinet crop received fertilizer and irrigation, while the 
      windbreak crop received neither. &#8220;In comparison to the reeds from 
      the windbreak, the reeds grown in the plantation had a significantly higher 
      proportion of cortical vascular bundles with a continuous fiber ring, 
      and had bundles with a higher proportion and area of fiber&#8230;.&#8221;<em><a href="#note22"><font size="-1">22</font></a></em> 
      In other words, the average stiffness was higher for the plantation reeds.</p>

      and Curing of Arundo Donax</font></strong></p>
    <p align="left">Knowing the age of the cane at harvest is important, as 
      explained above. The age of plantation cane will presumably always be 
      known. The age of commercially harvested wild cane may also be known, 
      especially if the field is regularly cut clear of all its cane. But an 
      enthusiast who happens upon a patch of wild cane is unlikely to know its 
      age, a difficulty addressed by Reid.<a href="#note23"><font size="-1"><em>23</em></font></a> 
    </p>
    <p align="left">The time for harvest is mid-December through March; later 
      harvesting is hazardous, because sprouts of a future crop would then be 
      underfoot.<a href="#note24"><font size="-1"><em>24</em></font></a> Reid 
      provided further specifics:</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Picking 
        a good day in early January provides good results. Conditions must have 
        been cold for several weeks, which allows the sap in the cane stalk 
        to return to the portion of the plants in the ground. When harvested 
        too early, the sap remains and the cane stalks take on a greenish color, 
        which no amount of drying or soaking can eliminate.<a href="#note25"><em>25</em></a></font> 
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left">The curing and seasoning process is important in a chemical 
      sense, Casadonte explained, because it reduces the formerly living stem 
      to a sort of skeleton that is suitable for musical use. &#8220;The rigidity 
      of the cell walls of the plant (and subsequent reed) likewise stabilizes, 
      being far too pliable for musical use when first harvested&#8230;. Remaining 
      plasma membranes [cell walls] are drained or evaporated, leaving the form, 
      but little of the substance of the original material.&#8221;<em><a href="#note26"><font size="-1">26</font></a></em> 
    </p>
    <p align="left">A wide range of curing regimens has been reported, ranging 
      from a few months to a few years, with differing sequences of sunning 
      and drying, outdoors or under shelter. The Glotin firm, after exposing 
      bassoon cane to the sun for 10 to 15 days, seasons the cane for up to 
      two years indoors. The firm&#8217;s seasoning barn is unusual, according 
      to Daniele Glotin, in that its design allows constant ventilation.<a href="#note27"><font size="-1"><em>27</em></font></a>

    <p align="left"><a href="#top">[Top]</a></p>
    <p align="left"><strong><font size="+1"><a name="section4"></a>4. Water 
      Absorption of Arundo Donax</font></strong></p>
    <p align="left">A young bassoonist typically learns in the first lesson 
      that the reed is not expected to vibrate until it has been thoroughly 
      soaked. But why is this so? Scientists have explained that this soaking 
      (or hydration, as they prefer to call it) has important effects on the 
      vibrational characteristics of even a simple rectangular section (a clarinet 
      reed blank, for example) of Arundo donax, tending to lessen the stiffness 
      and lower the vibrating frequency. When a piece of cane is made into a 
      finished bassoon reed, additional effects of hydration come into play.</p>
    <p align="left">Casadonte carried out an experiment to measure a vibrational 
      difference between unsoaked and soaked Arundo donax. He first clamped 
      a dry, rectangular sample of Arundo donax and plucked it, obtaining a 
      frequency of 269 Hz. When he soaked the cane sample and repeated the experiment, 
      the frequency dropped to 220Hz. A physicist would say that the modulus 
      of elasticity drops exponentially (that is, the cane becomes more flexible) 
      as the reed is saturated.<a href="#note28"><font size="-1"><em>28</em></font></a> 
      It also gains in mass, as explained below.</p>
    <p align="left">Double reeds are subject to additional physical forces. 
      In the special case of a bassoon reed, the swelling of soaked tissues 
      causes the reed&#8217;s tip to pucker and the aperture to open to a functional 
      dimension. </p>
    <p align="left">When a bassoon reed is hydrated, &#8220;free&#8221; water 
      is stored within the cellular cavities and vascular tissue capillaries. 
      According to Casadonte, the degree of swelling in a clarinet reed, taken 
      new from its box and then fully hydrated to a level suitable for performance, 
      is greatest in the radial (inside-to-outside) dimension: 16.8%. The reed 
      also swells 7.5 % in the tangential (left-to-right) dimension, and 4.5% 
      in the longitudinal (tip-to-butt) dimension. The weight or mass added 
      by free water is 3.75 %.<a href="#note29"><font size="-1"><em>29</em></font></a> 
      We can assume that the degree of swelling is somewhat less in a bassoon 
      reed, which is gouged thinner; it thus contains a higher proportion of 
      sclerified cells, and absorbs less water. </p>
    <p align="left">When the bassoon reed is allowed to dry, the tip aperture 
      will often become partly or fully closed. But hydrating (fully soaking) 
      the reed causes the blades to swell in thickness, increasing the tension 
      and restoring the tip aperture to the correct degree of openness, a critical 
      requirement for correct vibration of the reed. This additional effect 
      occurs because the tip of the reed is thereby placed under additional 
      tension. </p>
    <p align="left">Some tension is present in the bassoon reed even before 
      it is soaked. What might be called &#8220;dry&#8221; tension arises from 
      (1) the deformation of the cane&#8217;s natural arc into a flatter arc 
      at the reed&#8217;s tip, and (2) the deformation of the natural arc into 
      a much tighter arc at the back of the blade.<a href="#note30"><font size="-1"><em>30</em></font></a> 
      Hydration brings about two new effects that might be called &#8220;wet&#8221; 
      tension: (3) the hydrated blades increase in thickness; given that movement 
      of each blade is constrained by its contact with the other blade, the 
      swollen blades can only expand by assuming a higher arch. In a secondary 
      effect, (4) the hydrated tube of the reed swells against the brass adjustment 
      wires, and the resulting pressures further influence the tip aperture.</p>

    <p align="left">To understand more about the hydration process of the bassoon 
      reed, we need to know a few details of the chemistry of Arundo donax. 
      According to Casadonte, different researchers analyzed five different 
      stems of Arundo donax, with the following results: 42-50% cellulose, 20-24% 
      hemicelluloses, and about 10-20% lignin, ash 4%, silica 1-2%.</p>
    <p align="left">Aside from the &#8220;free water&#8221; stored in a hydrated 
      reed (as described above), a separate quantity of water is bound to the 
      cellulose-hemicellulose-lignin matrix &#8220;more or less permanently.&#8221; 
      This &#8220;bound water,&#8221; as Casadonte termed it, comprises 5.98% 
      of the weight of the clarinet reed. </p>
    <p align="left">The amount of bound water varies slightly with changes in 
      atmospheric pressure. As pressure increases, hydration is increased, and 
      vice versa. Casadonte found that swelling due to bound water could reach 
      .75% in the radial dimension, .63% in the tangential dimension, and .4% 
      in the longitudinal dimension.<a href="#note31"><font size="-1"><em>31</em></font></a> 
      (Over its useful life, the reed gradually loses hemicellulose; this loss 
      decreases the amount of bound water that can be stored. This phenomenon 
      is discussed below.)<br>

    <p align="left"><strong><font size="+1"><a name="section5"></a>5. The Life 
      Cycle of a Reed</font></strong></p>
    <p align="left">It is a truism among bassoonists that even good reeds change 
      over time, from youth to middle age to old age. We are now in a position 
      to ask what chemical and physical changes are at work in this aging process. 
    </p>
    <p align="left">About 20-24% of Arundo donax tissue is hemicellulose (various 
      types, but primarily AMGX), the purpose of which is to aid in absorption 
      of water in the living plant. Even in the dead tissue of the bassoon reed, 
      it continues this function. Casadonte reported that the &#8220;breaking-in&#8221; 
      process for the clarinet reed is largely a matter of the leaching out 
      of AMGX &#8211; which has a slightly sweet taste &#8211; through repeated 
      use of the reed.</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As 
        the reed is played upon, the sweet taste gradually diminishes, and the 
        reed becomes gradually less hydrophilic, until some stable point is 
        reached. This is the point at which the reed is generally said to be 
        &#8220;broken in.&#8221; These effects are probably due to the loss 
        of hemicellulose in the reed cell wall matrix&#8230;.<a href="#note32"><em>32</em></a> 
        </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left">As the reed continues to age, (1) the loss of AMGX continues. 
      Two other types of chemical breakdown occur: </p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(2) 
        [C]ontamination of the reed due to salival artifact (amines, glycoproteins, 
        sialic acid, etc.). These breakdown pathways render the material, in 
        effect, more brittle and less hydrophilic&#8230;. (3) [S]aliva contains 
        ammonia and other alkali, and these have been shown to induce plasticization 
        [softening] in wood. The result is that the modulus of the material 
        falls (the reed becomes &#8220;softer&#8221;), and the damping increases 
        (the reed does not maintain sound easily).<a href="#note33"><em>33</em></a> 
        </font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left">Other factors in the aging process are physical rather than 
      chemical. Casadonte reported that contamination by saliva and oral microflora 
      causes an increase in the mass of the reed&#8217;s blades. Casadonte also 
      identified another bacterium strain that adds mass to the clarinet reed&#8217;s 
      tip, changes its shape, and reduces its range of motion.<a href="#note34"><font size="-1"><em>34</em></font></a> 
    </p>
    <p align="left">Unlike the hemicellulose AMGX, lignin does not leach out 
      of the bassoon reed. In fact, lignin is hydrophobic, or water repelling.<a href="#note35"><font size="-1"><em>35</em></font></a> 
      Nor does reed use cause lignin to break down through mechanical faults 
      like cracking and tearing. In this sense, the reed does not simply &#8220;wear 
      out,&#8221; as Casadonte explained.<a href="#note36"><font size="-1"><em>36</em></font></a> 
    </p>
    <p align="left">Bassoon reeds are subject to additional types of degradation. 
      Even before the chemical aging process renders a bassoon reed undependable, 
      the reed will suffer from a gradual closing of the tip aperture over time. 
      This is probably due to two factors. One is a gradual deformation called 
      mechano-sorptive creep. Because lignin is amorphous (fluid), it does not 
      always make a perfect recovery from the swelling that results from hydration. 
      Instead, some deformation due to swelling remains, which Casadonte termed 
      mechano-sorptive creep.<a href="#note37"><font size="-1"><em>37</em></font></a> 
    </p>
    <p align="left">The second is a gradual loss of wet tension, as explained 
      above. This is correctable through wire adjustments, but only partially 
      so. A reed that absorbs less water expands less. The less absorbent blades 
      swell less upon hydration, so that the tip aperture, under reduced wet 
      tension, opens less. In addition, the brass wires lose their original 
      tautness, so that they no longer exert proper pressure on the tip aperture. 
      The player usually re-adjusts the tip aperture by tautening and compressing 
      the wires. This adjustment helps extend the reed&#8217;s useful life, 
      but the reed may become less dependable in speech, due to the player&#8217;s 
      decreasing control over the tip aperture.</p>
    <p align="left">Various chemical remedies to the problem of reed aging have 
      been suggested. Casadonte suggested two new possibilities: (1) a water-based 
      antibacterial rinse (currently available by prescription only), and (2) 
      gas phase infiltration with parylene, a particularly inert polymer.<a href="#note38"><font size="-1"><em>38</em></font></a> 
      Ron L. Fox suggested a treatment based on cross-linking of cellulosic 
      chains to render the cane bio-resistant and wet stable, which improves 
      enzymatic degradation.<a href="#note39"><font size="-1"><em>39</em></font></a> 
      A commercially available product called ReedLife is recommended for clarinet 
      and saxophone reeds; its chemical basis and preservation strategy are 
      unknown.</p>

    <p align="left"><strong><font size="+1"><a name="section6"></a>6. The Virtues 
      of Desirable Cane According to Reed Makers</font></strong></p>
    <p align="left">We are now in a favorable position to review various cane 
      quality tests, most of them well known to bassoon reed makers. We are 
      not particularly interested in agreeing or disagreeing with a particular 
      test or author &#8211; the authors speak for themselves, and different 
      preferences are possible even among reed makers who agree on terminology. 
      Nor is it necessary to list every author who has ever described a particular 
      test. Our goal is rather to enumerate many of the different tests and 
      qualities that various authors have described, and to ask what relationships, 
      if any, exist among them. (We will omit simple inspections relating to 
      dimensions in the workpiece; these characteristics pose no particular 
      challenge for the experienced reed maker.)</p>
    <p align="left"><a href="#top">[Top]</a></p>
    <p align="left"><strong><font size="+1"><a name="section7"></a>7. Hardness</font></strong></p>
    <p align="left">Often cited as a desirable quality, hardness is sometimes 
      defined as &#8220;the resistance of metal [or other materials] to indentation 
      by an indenter of fixed shape and size under a static load or to scratching.&#8221;<em><a href="#note40"><font size="-1">40</font></a></em> 
      In this vein, Carl Almenr&auml;der recommended what he called the &#8220;finger 
      nail test&#8221; of cane hardness:</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Run 
        the thumbnail over the bark of the cane following its curvature, and 
        observe whether with normal pressure any mark is impressed upon the 
        cane. If none is left, you can be sure that the wood is too hard.</font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left">Almenr&auml;der preferred softer cane, although many of 
      his contemporaries preferred harder cane, as he made clear as he continued:</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Although 
        many will reply that &#8220;The hardest, most solid cane is most suited 
        to the making of bassoon reeds,&#8221; I will answer that if such reasoning 
        were followed to its conclusion, apparently even better reeds could 
        be made from wood that is harder and more solid than cane. Personally, 
        I would rather make my reeds out of a piece of pine wood than use the 
        hard cane which some bassoonists use.&#8221;<em><a href="#note41">41</a></em>

    <p align="left">But many modern authors, including Reid, have preferred 
      a harder result from this test:</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
        mark should be difficult to make and should not go very deeply into 
        the surface. As an example, the mark that the thumbnail can make on 
        a pencil is much too deep, and cane which allows such a deep mark will 
        be too soft and mushy to make a decent reed. The mark is like the indentation 
        that can be made on hardwood, and is not extremely visible but can be 
        felt with light thumbnail pressure.<a href="#note42"><em>42</em></a></font>

    </blockquote>
    <p align="left">Various meters commercially available for this task measure 
      the penetration of a spring-loaded probe into the inner surface of gouged 
      cane. But which is significant, the hardness of the inner surface, or 
      of the outer surface? </p>
    <p align="left">James M. Poe noted that he tested cane hardness with such 
      a meter.<a href="#note43"><font size="-1"><em>43</em></font></a> Although 
      he did not specify, it was apparently the inside surface Poe tested (he 
      was able to conclude that &#8220;cane increases in hardness as it gets 
      closer to the rind&#8221;). Poe did not specify whether he was testing 
      the cane wet or dry.</p>
    <p align="left">Lawrence J. Intravia&#8217;s hardness test differed in some 
      respects from Poe&#8217;s. He tested the cane both wet and dry, and he, 
      by contrast, measured the outer surface &#8220;because of the extreme 
      softness of the pitch [pith] of the cane.&#8221;<em><a href="#note44"><font size="-1">44</font></a></em> 
      It may be that the testing equipment available to Intravia before his 
      death in 1973 &#8211; a Rockwell Superficial Hardness Tester, which had 
      a &#8220;diamond cone indenter&#8221; with a minimum load of 15 kilograms 
      &#8211; was not sensitive enough to test the softer side of bassoon reed 
      cane. </p>
    <p align="left">A cruder version of Intravia&#8217;s hardness assessment 
      is sometimes called the &#8220;stab&#8221; test: the assessor probes the 
      outer surfaces of successive pieces of cane (usually wet and gouged) with 
      a knife point or stylus, making a subjective rating or ranking of the 
      resistance that each piece offers. </p>
    <p align="left">It is an irony that many of these hardness tests, which 
      address the outer surface of cane, measure a part of the cane that will 
      be trimmed away and discarded in the making of a typical reed for the 
      modern, German-system bassoon. Yet testing for hardness on either surface 
      of gouged cane seems to yield useful information to the bassoon reed maker. 
      This may be because the fiber band can be &#8220;felt&#8221; through the 
      epidermis. The fiber band, made up of lignin, apparently develops at the 
      same rate as the vascular sheathing in the inner cortex. Thus the hardness 
      of the fiber band may be correlated with the hardness of the inner cortex, 
      which will make up most of the vibrating blades of a bassoon reed.<a href="#note45"><font size="-1"><em>45</em></font></a>

    <p align="left"><strong><font size="+1"><a name="section8"></a>8. Density</font></strong></p>
    <p align="left">Density is &#8220;the mass of a substance per unit volume.&#8221;<em><a href="#note46"><font size="-1">46</font></a></em> 
      In Lacy&#8217;s flotation test, numerous equal-sized pieces of dry cane 
      in the gouged state were floated in a water-filled cylinder, the result 
      being that some sank further into the water than others. The percentage 
      of submerged length was noted for each. The further a piece sank, the 
      higher its density or specific gravity. Lacy did not explain how he tested 
      the same pieces for hardness, but he went on to report &#8220;a strong 
      correlation&#8221; between the hardness test and the density test.<a href="#note47"><font size="-1"><em>47</em></font></a> 
      Jean-Marie Heinrich described a more elaborate density test that employs 
      a pycnometer (a vessel designed for measuring density) and a precision-weight 
      scale.<a href="#note48"><font size="-1"><em>48</em></font></a> </p>
    <p align="left">A perceived correlation between density and hardness dates 
      back to the early 19th century at least. Almenr&auml;der&#8217;s treatise 
      on bassoon playing and reed making was published in 1842 with parallel 
      German and French texts. When &#8220;hart&#8221; (hard) appears in the 
      German, &#8220;dense&#8221; (dense) appears in the French, no further 
      explanation having seemed necessary to the publisher.<a href="#note49"><font size="-1"><em>49</em></font></a>

    <p align="left"><strong><a name="section9"></a></strong><strong><font size="+1">9. 
      Flexibility, Elasticity, Resiliency, and Stiffness</font></strong> </p>
    <p align="left">These concepts are closely related. The word flexible is 
      &#8220;applicable to anything capable of being bent &#8230; without being 
      broken and with or without returning of itself to its former shape.&#8221; 
      Its opposite is stiffness, which is &#8220;the resistance (as of a structural 
      beam) to bending under stresses within the elastic limit, with no emphasis 
      on return to the original shape.&#8221; </p>
    <p align="left">Between these opposites are elasticity and resiliency. &#8220;Elastic 
      indicates ability to stretch, expand, or take on new shape under pressure, 
      usually with return to an original shape or position after pressure is 
      withdrawn.&#8221; The word can be troublesome, because some uses focus 
      on the aspect of flexibility, while others focus on the return. Resilient, 
      in contrast, &#8220;stresses an ability to spring back and recover shape 
      with the removal of pressure.&#8221;<em><a href="#note50"><font size="-1">50</font></a></em> 
      It is thus unambiguous on the issue of return. </p>
    <p align="left">Intravia identified another quality that he called recovery. 
      He flexed a piece of cane for five minutes, then measured its ability 
      to spring back to its original shape. This might be taken as a quantitative 
      measure of resilience. But what Intravia measured under this name was 
      not a realistic simulation of the musical vibration of a bassoon reed, 
      the frequency of which would be many flexings per second. (Such a test 
      might instead have shed light on the aging process of a reed, although 
      this has yet to be determined. Perhaps Intravia&#8217;s &#8220;recovery&#8221; 
      is resistance to mechano-sorptive creep, as discussed above.)</p>
    <p align="left">To test stiffness, Intravia clamped gouged pieces of cane 
      at one end in a horizontal position and applied a downward bending force. 
      He found that &#8220;in general, the rank orders follow a similar pattern 
      when tested wet and dry. This fact suggests that perhaps one testing might 
      be sufficient.&#8221;<em><a href="#note51"><font size="-1">51</font></a></em> 
      Interestingly, he also found that the exceptions &#8211; certain pieces 
      which tested harder when wet than when dry &#8211; were obtained from 
      the same source. </p>
    <p align="left">Reid described another popular assessment, which might be 
      called the torsion or twisting test.</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Hold 
        the soaked cane in both hands at the very ends and gently twist to about 
        a 45 degree angle&#8230;. The cane should be flexible, not rigid, and 
        it should spring quickly back into original shape.<a href="#note52"><em>52</em></a></font> 
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left">Poe quantified this same sort of test by clamping one end 
      of the test piece, using a constant weight to apply torsional force to 
      the other end, and measuring the angle of deflection by protractor. (He 
      did not specify whether the test piece was wet or dry.)<a href="#note53"><font size="-1"><em>53</em></font></a> 
      An important requirement for these tests of flexibility is that the test 
      pieces be closely isomorphic &#8211; that is, of identical length, width, 
      thickness, and curvature. Otherwise, the results will be skewed by unintended 
      variables.</p>
    <p align="left">A related test of flexibility might be called the &#8220;pucker 
      test&#8221;: a finished reed is soaked, and the blades are compressed 
      from the sides above the first wire. A reed whose aperture flexes open 
      several times its normal width is judged to be too flexible (and possibly 
      not resilient enough), while a reed whose aperture can be flexed open 
      only a little further than normal is judged to be acceptable cane. By 
      this late stage, unfortunately, most of the maker&#8217;s labor has already 
      been expended, whether the cane is desirable or not.</p>
    <p align="left"><a href="#top">[Top]</a></p>
    <p align="left"><strong><font size="+1"><a name="section10"></a>10. Resonant 
      Frequency</font></strong></p>
    <p align="left">Lacy briefly mentioned the &#8220;dynamic&#8221; test, which 
      involves dropping dry pieces of gouged cane onto a hard surface and noting 
      the resulting pitch.<a href="#note54"><font size="-1"><em>54</em></font></a> 
      This is a way of identifying the resonant frequency of the cane segment, 
      as a physicist would call it. Lacy did not go into specifics, but conventional 
      wisdom is that the higher the resonant frequency or pitch, the more desirable 
      the cane tends to be. As with the flexibility tests, the test pieces must 
      be identical in all dimensions, so that results will not be skewed by 
      unintended variables.</p>
    <p align="left"><a href="#top">[Top]</a></p>
    <p align="left"><strong><font size="+1"><a name="section11"></a>11. Color</font></strong></p>
    <p align="left">The color of the cane on both outer and inner surfaces is 
      often said to be an indicator of quality. Vernon Read, for example, considered 
      that a yellow outside was ideal, while purple-yellowish is &#8220;usually 
      a sign of good aging.&#8221; Greenish-yellow cane &#8220;may be great 
      with proper aging, while brown &#8220;may be old, past prime, though worth 
      a try.&#8221; Deep green is &#8220;not good, needs another year,&#8221; 
      while white is &#8220;dying&#8221; and gray is &#8220;dead.&#8221;<em><a href="#note55"><font size="-1">55</font></a></em> 
      Casadonte explained some of the scientific background for color analysis: 
      &#8220;As cane ages, the relative amount of xyanthophyll (which is yellow) 
      increases and the amount of chlorophyll (which is green) decreases.&#8221; 
      Brown discoloration on the epidermis of the cane is harmless tannin, not 
      leaf marks, he also explained.<a href="#note56"><font size="-1"><em>56</em></font></a> 
      Color is primarily a means of verifying that proper harvesting or curing 
      procedures have been observed, something many cane purchasers take for 
      granted. </p>
    <p align="left"><a href="#top">[Top]</a></p>
    <p align="left"><strong><font size="+1"><a name="section12"></a>12. Resistance 
      to Tools</font></strong></p>
    <p align="left">When the reed maker is at work, the cane may offer greater 
      or lesser resistance to the tool or machine (a gouger or profiler, for 
      example). Reed makers appear to favor a more resistant feel. Reid said 
      that:</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p align="left"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
        scrape of the gouger blade makes the final test. The first few passes 
        of the blade remove the membrane and soft fibrous materials. Resistance 
        of each successive blade pass should increase until the desired thickness 
        is achieved. Watch the grain carefully as the last few passes are made. 
        The removed curls of cane should have even and compact grains.<a href="#note57"><em>57</em></a> 
        </font> </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left">More than a century before Reid, Almenr&auml;der had noted 
      that desirable cane had a certain tenacity, or resistance to the gouging 
      tool.<a href="#note58"><font size="-1"><em>58</em></font></a> This is 
      of interest, because Almenr&auml;der professed to dislike hard cane. Thus 
      this quality appears to be separable from hardness.</p>

    <p align="left"><strong><font size="+1"><a name="section13"></a>13. Conclusions</font></strong></p>
    <p align="left">Scientific researchers are united in their findings that 
      stiffness is desirable in reed cane, and that it results from a specific 
      anatomical feature: the fiber sheathing of vascular cell bundles in the 
      inner cortex. The favorable development of this anatomical feature has 
      been linked, moreover, to specific agricultural practices, including spacing, 
      irrigation, fertilization, climate, age of the stem, and age of an internode 
      within the stem. This is all worth knowing, even if the average reed maker 
      ultimately has to trust a commercial grower to ensure that the best agricultural 
      decisions have been made.</p>
    <p align="left"> While scientists have focused on the quality of stiffness, 
      many bassoon reed makers have tended to test for either hardness or flexibility. 
      These three concepts are separable, even if intuition tells some bassoonists 
      that the first two are similar, while the last is their opposite. But 
      bassoonists are not unanimous in this intuitive belief. Intravia was exceptional 
      in attempting to test separately for hardness, stiffness, and &#8220;recovery,&#8221; 
      which was a sort of resiliency. He concluded that &#8220;cane that tested 
      the softest was also the least stiff and had the greatest amount of recovery.&#8221; 
      In other words, recovery was negatively correlated with hardness and stiffness. 
      Intravia preferred cane with these qualities. Surprisingly, Intravia also 
      concluded that &#8220;cane in which there is a positive correlation between 
      hardness, stiffness and amount of recovery makes the best reeds regardless 
      of the strength desired by the maker.&#8221; This apparent contradiction 
      is not easy to explain, although Intravia questioned the validity of his 
      hardness test, &#8220;because the structure of cane makes it impossible 
      to produce consistent readings using the Rockwell Superficial Hardness 
      Tester.&#8221;<em><a href="#note59"><font size="-1">59</font></a></em> 
      Perhaps a latter-day researcher equipped with a suitable hardness tester 
      and a flexibility test more analogous to performance conditions will be 
      able to duplicate Intravia&#8217;s results. </p>
    <p align="left">The importance of these conceptual distinctions and experimental 
      methods becomes clear when we compare one of Intravia&#8217;s results 
      with one of Poe&#8217;s. After culling out &#8220;the extreme ends of 
      the distribution which are too soft or too hard,&#8221; Poe then concluded 
      that &#8220;cane that is softer requires less flexibility to make a good 
      reed whereas harder cane requires greater flexibility.&#8221;<em><a href="#note60"><font size="-1">60</font></a></em> 
      This seems to be the opposite of a finding by Intravia: &#8220;Cane may 
      be discarded if it tests either stiff and soft, or hard and flexible.&#8221;<em><a href="#note61"><font size="-1">61</font></a></em> 
    </p>
    <p align="left">Researchers and reed makers have explored other correlations. 
      Lacy&#8217;s experiment allowed him to establish a correlation between 
      hardness and density in cane. Anecdotal experience suggests that stiffness 
      might be correlated with a higher resonant frequency, but a controlled 
      scientific investigation would be desirable. Carefully designed experiments 
      and equally careful reporting of results may eventually establish beyond 
      question the strength of correlation between any two of the qualities 
      mentioned. This would be an important step forward for reed makers.</p>
    <p align="left">No matter what tests are performed, different bassoonists 
      will not always prefer the same pieces of cane. There is a significant 
      reason for some of this dissent: material (cane) is only one of many elements 
      of bassoon reed design. Different bassoonists make long reeds or short, 
      narrow reeds or wide, with thickly or thinly gouged cane, with or without 
      a collar, and with a blade shape that may have straight, convex, or concave 
      rails. This polymorphic profusion of options for the bassoon reed contrasts 
      sharply with the isomorphic regularity of clarinet reeds, which have few 
      dimensional variables. Such stylistic options are in addition to the environmental 
      variables shared by single- and double-reed players: climate, altitude, 
      performance space, ensemble taste, and the peculiarities of the player&#8217;s 
      own instrument. </p>

      <strong>11.</strong><a name="note11"></a> Casadonte, 209. &#8220;According 
      to some experimental work done by Benade together with Walter Worman and 
      Daniel Wright, the particular virtue of Arundo donax for reed making lies 
      in its high ratio of longitudinal stiffness to density, together with 
      great transverse flexibility at appropriate thickness.&#8221; Philip Bate,

      <strong>15.</strong><a name="note15"></a> &#8220;[T]he ground tissue may 
      be modeled as an extended imperfect lattice, such as one might see in 
      a crystal&#8230;. [B]ecause of the simple, nearly regular ordering pattern 
      of these hollow/filled [with lignin] unit cells, we suspect that energy 
      is much more efficiently dissipated throughout the ground tissue or Arundo 
      donax than in more amorphously structured wood ground tissue. This efficiency 
      is likely one reason for the unusually high damping coefficient of Arundo 
      donax (more than ten times that of wood) &#8211; the energy resulting 
      from an impulse applied to the ground tissue is siphoned away from the 
      initial site of impulse at a very high rate.&#8221; Casadonte, 103 and 
      106. <br>
      &#8220;The amorphous material (typically concentrated around the vascular 
      tissue in the form of lignin), is essentially a superviscous fluid, and 
      stores the applied stress, much as a dashpot [shock absorber] might store 
      mechanical energy, or a capacitor store electrical energy. The crystalline 
      or ordered cellulose lattice, on the other hand, is essentially elastic, 
      responding as a spring might to mechanical stress, or a resistor might 
      to an electrical stress.&#8221; Casadonte, 279.<br>

      pile for three months, then on outdoor racks another three to four months. 
      Bate, 21, reported a longer process: &#8220;The stems are cut when still 
      green &#8230; and gathered into conical stacks and left to season in a 
      cool, dry place outdoors. During the seasoning, which usually takes two 
      years but may last up to four, selected stems are carefully watched and 
      are turned at intervals, as they develop a rich golden-yellow color with 
      various degrees of mottling.&#8221;<br>

      did not involve a bassoon reed, nor was the excitation mechanism the same 
      as blowing a reed, but the trend, at least, would presumably hold for 
      a bassoon reed in normal use.<br>
