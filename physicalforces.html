      <p align="left">Makers of reeds for the bassoon have a centuries-long head 
        start on acoustical physicists in trying to understand these remarkable 
        little tone generators. Even before the mid- to late 19th century, when 
        modern German- and French-system bassoons were developed, there were earlier 
        bassoons and earlier reed styles for the music of Bach&#8217;s and Beethoven&#8217;s 
        eras. Still earlier, makers produced reeds for dulcian in the age of Praetorius 
        and reeds for shawm in the age of Henry VIII. The reed maker of today 
        relies to a large extent on slowly evolving traditions: specifications, 
        work habits, and beliefs are handed down from one practical reed maker 
        to another. Various reed designs and production techniques have come to 
        be associated with different types of bassoon (French system versus German 
        system, for example, or modern versus historical), or with narrower national 
        or personal ideals.</p>
      <p align="left"> Acoustics came later. Scientific explanations of the reed&#8217;s 
        working began to appear only in the nineteenth century, and to flourish 
        only in the twentieth century, during the lifetime of the familiar modern 
        bassoon. The physical workings of the bassoon reed are quite sophisticated: 
        a variable air stream and two vibrating blades interact as a system. To 
        make matters more complicated, the tone generator (reed) is coupled to 
        a resonator (the bassoon) that has complicated physics itself, partly 
        because of its conical bore and its finger holes of irregular depth. All 
        these factors have made the bassoon and its reed harder to explain than 
        most other wind instruments. But acousticians have made large strides 
        in the last generation. By the late twentieth century, a respectable scientific 
        literature had grown up on the subject of the bassoon&#8217;s acoustics, 
        sometimes including the reed itself. </p>
      <p align="left">A survey of the scientific literature, coupled with experience 
        in making reeds for a wide variety of historical and modern bassoons, 
        suggests that the many different types of bassoon reed share certain acoustic 
        fundamentals. Variations of certain physical characteristics &#8211; length, 
        width, and thickness of the blades, for example &#8211; will have predictable 
        effects in the behavior of bassoon reeds, no matter the type of bassoon 
        or taste of the reed maker. The countless reed styles that exist appear 
        to be different strategies for harnessing the same physical forces. </p>
      <p align="left">Bassoon reed makers could learn many useful things from 
        acoustical scientists. Physicists, however, tend to seek quantitative 
        answers to their questions, and only the most mathematically minded of 
        bassoonists have attempted to penetrate the thickets of equations that 
        comprise most acoustical writings. But a middle way is possible: the bassoonist 
        can understand much of the science of the bassoon reed in a merely qualitative 
        way (that is, with no numbers or equations), as long as suitable readings 
        are available. Such a reader will discover a rational basis for many of 
        the traditional beliefs about reed making. Perhaps more important, the 
        bassoonist seeking particular adjustments or improvements in a given reed 
        design will know what steps are most likely to be helpful.</p>
      <p align="left"> In the following discussion, the emphasis is on physical 
        truths that can be put to immediate practical use by the reed maker, while 
        many topics of more academic interest are neglected. I have avoided much 
        scientific jargon that would be obscure to the average bassoonist, but 
        I have sometimes opted to introduce a useful scientific term rather than 
        engage in a roundabout paraphrase. Many of these terms are italicized, 
        alerting the reader that even a common-looking word has a scientific connotation 
        that may be pursued in a reference book.<font size="-1"><a href="#note1"><em>1</em></a></font> 
        I have numbered and italicized many observations that have immediate practical 
        applications, so that a reader can locate them quickly. </p>

      <p align="left"><strong><font size="+1"><a name="section1"></a>1. Various 
        Models for the Vibrating Bassoon Reed</font></strong></p>
      <p align="left">Much of the following discussion centers on the vibration 
        of the bassoon reed&#8217;s blades, and on how the rate of vibration is 
        affected by changes in the reed&#8217;s design. This rate of vibration 
        is of pivotal importance to the player, as we shall explain a little later. 
        Meanwhile, there are many useful models for studying the vibrations of 
        the reed. We will mention several before pursuing a few in depth.</p>
      <p align="left"><em><strong>The four-phase cycle.</strong></em> The bassoon 
        reed is easier to understand if we begin with an early peek at an overall 
        model of its vibrational cycle. After this, we will go back and examine 
        the constituent parts at a more fundamental level. The double reed of 
        the bassoon vibrates in a cycle of four phases.<font size="-1"><em><a href="#note2">2</a></em></font> 
        Bassoonists are used to seeing the reed in its first or static phase (fig 
        1). </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/Fig_01.gif" width="251" height="84"></p>
      <p align="center"><font size="-1"><em>Fig. 1. Four phases in the bassoon 
        reed&#8217;s vibrational cycle. Arrows represent air passing through a 
        reed, which is shown in profile. After Campbell and Greated, The Musician&#8217;s 
        Guide to Acoustics, 260.</em></font></p>
      <p align="left">In its second phase, the reed inflates, meaning that the 
        tip aperture increases in area and the corners of the two opposed blades 
        separate slightly from one another. (The reason for this inflation will 
        be discussed below.). By now, suction has been created by the acceleration 
        of the air stream through the reed tube. The suction causes the reed to 
        &#8220;deflate&#8221;; it passes through a third phase that looks identical 
        to the first phase, and then the tip closes (fourth phase). The pulsation 
        of the air column, aided by the elasticity and tension of the blades, 
        now causes them to spring open again, returning them to the first phase. 
        As long as the player continues the air stream, the cycle will repeat 
        itself, comprising what acousticians call a <strong><em>steady-state oscillation</em></strong>. 
        In the steady state, the reed becomes the slave of the bassoon&#8217;s 
        air column, which pulsates in an in-and-out motion. This reciprocal motion 
        is what causes the reed blades to inflate in phase 2: the deflation of 
        phase 4 is reciprocated by an inflation in phase 2. </p>
      <p align="left">The system of the double reed is complex in that it combines 
        elements of both <strong><em>solid mechanics</em></strong> (the blades) 
        and <strong><em>fluid mechanics</em></strong> (the air stream). This interaction 
        of the two physical phenomena is a marvel of nature, and a satisfactory 
        linking of the two is the goal of every reed maker, whether the reed maker 
        appreciates this or not. Several physical models are available for studying 
        the movement of the blades and air stream.</p>
      <p align="left"> One traditional model to be used here is sometimes called 
        the <strong><em>clamped-free elastic bar</em></strong>. A straight bar 
        is firmly clamped in a block heavy enough to immobilize the rod at one 
        end; the other end is free to vibrate (fig. 2). </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/Fig_02.gif" width="185" height="80"></p>
      <p align="center"><font size="-1"><em>Fig. 2. First-mode vibration of a 
        clamped-free bar. A straight, elastic bar clamped in a block at one end, 
        free to vibrate at the other end, is shown in the two extreme phases of 
        its vibration.</em></font></p>
      <p align="left">Being <strong><em>elastic</em></strong>, the rod will recover 
        its shape after <strong><em>deformation</em></strong> (bending). (A very 
        similar model, the <strong><em>cantilevered beam deflection model</em></strong>, 
        has been extensively studied by engineers.) A diving board is a realization 
        of such a model, and so is a clarinet reed. </p>
      <p align="left">It&#8217;s obvious that the bassoon reed is more complicated 
        in certain ways than a diving board, and only a more sophisticated model 
        will capture more of the subtleties of a real reed&#8217;s vibration. 
        Physicists have studied the vibration of <strong><em>plates</em></strong>, 
        which are thinner than bars and have distinct patterns of vibration. Among 
        musical instruments, the cymbal and gong are examples of plates. Plates 
        may also be cantilevered; the airplane wing is an important example. The 
        bassoon reed can be studied as a pair of plates cantilevered (clamped) 
        at one end. The wired tube of the reed is comparable to a clamp, while 
        each blade can be compared to a bar or plate clamped at one end (fig. 
        3). </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/Fig_03.gif" width="222" height="220"></p>
      <p align="center"><em><font size="-1">Fig. 3. A schematic drawing of a reed 
        for modern bassoon. Each blade may be compared to a bar clamped at one 
        end. Location of the throat, where the interior cavity of the reed is 
        narrowest, may vary from one reed design to another. The collar (unremoved 
        bark above the first wire) may vary in length or be absent.</font></em></p>
      <p align="left">Engineers have studied the vibration of even such special 
        cases as cantilevered plates with step-wise variations of thickness, and 
        cantilevered trapezoidal plates. It happens that the blade of a bassoon 
        reed is a trapezoid; its fourth and shortest side is defined by the first 
        wire. (Reed makers and engineers are usually looking at vibrations through 
        opposite ends of the same telescope. Engineers usually seek to minimize 
        vibrations, so they generally cantilever their trapezoidal plates on a 
        long side. Reed makers, in contrast, seek maximum vibration [within limits], 
        so the trapezoidal blades of the reed are always connected to the tube 
        on the shortest side.)</p>
      <p align="left"> Yet even these special cases do not take account of the 
        internal cavity between the paired blades. Each blade may also be considered 
        as a <strong><em>shell</em></strong>, which is a special category of plate, 
        marked by both concavity and convexity. A bell is a musical example of 
        a vibrating shell. Engineers have studied the vibrations of certain types 
        of shells, and the analysis has proved to be extremely complex. Scientists 
        have also studied the vibrations of <strong><em>membranes</em></strong>, 
        which differ from simple plates in being held under <strong><em>tension</em></strong>. 
        A drumhead is a musical example of a vibrating membrane. The bassoon reed 
        also has certain tensions applied to it, by the wires and binding that 
        deform the cane from its original circumference. </p>
      <p align="left">A further complication is that <strong><em>arundo donax</em></strong>, 
        the cane from which bassoon reeds are made, is a discontinuous material 
        having several interesting characteristics that affect its vibration. 
        It is layered (containing both &#8220;bark&#8221; and pith) and its barky 
        outer layer is more elastic (stiffer) than the pithier inner layer.<font size="-1"><a href="#note3"><em>3</em></a></font> 
        Moreover, the cane has multiple dimensions of elasticity that affect the 
        reed&#8217;s vibration. Two of these will concern us here: the <strong><em>longitudinal</em></strong> 
        (lengthwise) and the <strong><em>circumferential</em></strong> (along 
        the curve of the bark).<a href="#note4"><font size="-1"><em>4</em></font></a> 
      </p>
      <p align="left">The vibration of a bassoon reed is an example of <strong><em>forced</em></strong> 
        vibration, meaning that a force has been continuously applied to the surface, 
        sustaining the vibration. The force here is not, physically speaking, 
        the air stream supplied by the player, but rather the oscillations of 
        the air column in the bassoon. It is true, however, that the air stream 
        -- beginning in the player&#8217;s body, continuing between the blades, 
        and passing through the crook into the bassoon &#8211; is the energy source 
        for these oscillations.</p>
      <p align="left"> Specialists in the field of fluid mechanics study the flow 
        of air and other fluids, including the suction effect that helps close 
        the bassoon reed in its fourth cycle. One researcher has suggested that 
        two very complex models from the field &#8211; <strong><em>vortex shedding</em></strong> 
        and <strong><em>flapping flutter</em></strong> &#8211; may eventually 
        be found to be applicable to the study of bassoon reed vibration.<a href="#note5"><font size="-1"><em>5</em></font></a> 
      </p>
      <p align="left">While all these models have particular virtues, the clamped-free 
        bar appeals most directly to the intuition of the non-physicist. It is 
        also a model whose operations can be directly translated into principles 
        of general use by reed makers. While use of the model is illustrative 
        and thought provoking, we must remember that it gives only a crude approximation 
        of a few aspects of a reed&#8217;s behavior; many complications and subtleties 
        are purposely ignored here. Before we turn to this model, however, we 
        must understand a little more about the role the reed plays in the acoustic 
        system of the bassoon.</p>
      <p align="left"><a href="#beginning">[Top] </a></p>
      <p align="left"><strong><font size="+1"><a name="section2"></a>2. The Reed 
        as Part of the Acoustic System of the Bassoon</font></strong></p>
      <p align="left">The proper size of a bassoon reed is mandated by the <strong><em>truncation</em></strong> 
        of the bassoon&#8217;s <strong><em>air column</em></strong>. The air column 
        (bore) is a long, gradual cone, except that a portion of the small end 
        is missing (fig. 4). </p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/Fig_04.gif" width="257" height="77"></p>
      <p align="center"><em><font size="-1">Fig. 4. A schematic drawing of the 
        air column of the bassoon. The apical portion is not literally present, 
        its place being taken by the reed.</font></em></p>
      <p align="left">The maximum diameter at the bell is about 40 mm. The smallest 
        diameter actually present, at the small end of the bocal, is about 4 mm. 
        If the cone&#8217;s taper continued beyond the bocal tip to the theoretical 
        end of the cone, the &#8220;missing&#8221; portion of the cone would be 
        almost a foot long. To be an effective tone generator, the reed must take 
        the place of this missing <strong><em>apical</em></strong> portion (named 
        after the <strong><em>apex</em></strong> or tip). The <strong> <em>static 
        size</em></strong> of the bassoon&#8217;s reed measures less than one-quarter 
        of this missing length.</p>
      <p align="left">Acousticians use the term <strong><em>equivalent volume</em></strong> 
        to describe how much of the missing apical portion a given reed serves 
        to replace; a good reed replaces 100% of the missing volume. But the missing 
        volume is not a simple matter of the reed&#8217;s internal volume. Instead, 
        equivalent volume is measured in terms of <strong><em>vibrational size</em></strong>, 
        which is always larger than the <strong><em>static size</em></strong>. 
        Because any functioning reed&#8217;s blades are flexible, they effectively 
        increase the size of the reed. The flexibility of the blades is associated 
        with a physical quality called <strong><em>compliance</em></strong>.<a href="#note6"><font size="-1"><em>6</em></font></a> 
        Many reed makers understand compliance intuitively, even if they do not 
        use the term. Increased compliance lowers the frequency of a vibrating 
        body; in the bassoon reed, it makes for an easy crow and easy low-note 
        response, among many other effects.<a href="#note7"><font size="-1"><em>7</em></font></a> 
        Lower compliance raises the frequency of a vibrating body; in the bassoon 
        reed, it makes for a reluctant crow and easy high-note response. In achieving 
        a perfect vibrational size for a bassoon reed, the maker must balance 
        the reed&#8217;s static size with a suitable amount of compliance. </p>
      <p align="left">I&#8217;ve promised the reader an equation-free article, 
        but I&#8217;m going to make a brief and painless exception here. The following 
        equation simply restates the gist of the preceding paragraph:</p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Vibrational 
        size of a reed = Static size + Compliance</font></p>
      <p align="left"> If we wish to isolate (and thus define, in a non-scientific 
        way) the compliance of a bassoon reed, we can instead say:</p>
      <p align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Compliance = 
        Vibrational size &#8211; Static size</font></p>
      <p align="left"> Calculating the actual quantity of this compliance would 
        be quite a chore even for a trained physicist, and the numerical answer 
        would be of little use to the average reed maker. (Physicists express 
        compliance in terms of displacement per unit of force, or meters per <strong> 
        <em>newton</em></strong>.) But we can say that a successful bassoon reed 
        has enough compliance for easy low notes, but not so much that high-note 
        response becomes difficult. In the following discussion, we will point 
        out which design factors increase compliance in the reed, and which factors 
        decrease compliance.<a href="#note8"><font size="-1"><em>8</em></font></a> 
        Without troubling to calculate the meters per newton of compliance in 
        our reeds, we can benefit from understanding the underlying tendencies. 
        It&#8217;s useful to remember, during the following discussion of the 
        reed&#8217;s vibration, that frequency and compliance are inversely related.</p>

        Vibration of a One-Dimensional Reed: The Clamped-Free Bar</strong><em><strong></strong></em></font></p>
      <p align="left">The interplay of two physical qualities, mass and elasticity, 
        gives rise to vibrations in mechanical systems, including the bassoon 
        reed.<a href="#note9"><font size="-1"><em>9</em></font></a> As used in 
        this study, elasticity denotes resilience or stiffness &#8211; the tendency 
        for a material to return to its original shape after being deformed. Physicists 
        have studied the <strong><em>transverse vibrations</em></strong> of a 
        rod or bar that is firmly clamped at one end and free at the other. This 
        is called a <strong><em>clamped-free bar</em></strong>, and a similar 
        vibrating reed is called a <strong><em>clamped-free reed</em></strong>. 
        The frequency at which such a bar vibrates may be controlled in predictable 
        ways by modifications to the shape and length of the bar. Rises in frequency 
        are associated with reduced compliance; drops in frequency are associated 
        with increased compliance.</p>
      <p align="left">The frequency of the vibrating bar may be lowered by lengthening 
        the bar or by uniformly reducing the thickness of the bar. The frequency 
        may be raised, conversely, by shortening the bar, or by uniformly increasing 
        the thickness of the bar (figs. 5a &#8211; 5e).</p>

        than thickness.<a href="#note10"><font size="-1"><em>10</em></font></a> 
      </p>
      <p align="left">The frequency of the vibrating bar may also be lowered by 
        <strong><em>loading</em></strong> the end; for example, a weight could 
        be soldered or glued onto the free end of the bar. It is not a casual 
        matter to calculate the exact frequency drop caused by loading the bar, 
        but it is generally true that the closer to the free end such a weight 
        is added, the greater the frequency drop; the greater the weight added, 
        the greater the frequency drop. The matters of length, thickness and loading 
        can be directly compared to characteristics of a bassoon reed&#8217;s 
        blades; within limits, the blades can be long or short, thick or thin, 
        and of a greater or lesser slope. Here we will mention only the effect 
        of variation in the first dimension (length).</p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. A longer blade 
        will be more compliant, if other factors remain constant; a shorter blade 
        will be less compliant.</font></p>
      <p align="left">It is also worth noting that these characteristics are most 
        consistent when the clamped end of the vibrating bar is completely immobilized 
        by a clamp of sufficient mass. The reed&#8217;s tube and binding add some 
        stability and mass, but the adjustable wires represent a complicating 
        factor, which is discussed later.</p>

      <p align="left">We may say all this a little more concisely by referring 
        to the ratio of tip width to throat width<a href="#note11"><font size="-1"><em>11</em></font></a> 
        (figs. 8a &#8211; 8c). </p>

      <p align="left">The reed will vibrate only within a fairly narrow range 
        of tip-to-throat ratios. </p>
      <p align="left">If the reed&#8217;s blades are curved in the second dimension 
        (which a bassoonist would call the <strong><em>shape</em></strong>), the 
        curve will have predictable but mixed effects on the reed&#8217;s internal 
        volume, and thus on its static size. Suppose, for the purposes of discussion, 
        that we have a reed of a given design, including straight rails, in which 
        static size and compliance are in perfect balance. Changing the rails 
        of this reed to convex (only a theoretical possibility for the given reed, 
        of course) would result in increased internal volume. Given our introductory 
        equation, this would demand that some compliance be subtracted by means 
        of some other design factor, so that the reed does not become overly compliant, 
        with difficult high-register response (figs. 9a &#8211; 9b).</p>

      <p align="left"> (Convex rails lead at the same time to decreased <strong><em>damping</em></strong> 
        of the reed tip aperture, another significant effect. <strong><em>Damping</em></strong> 
        refers to the tendency of vibrations to diminish and die. Here we use 
        the term <strong><em>tip damping</em></strong> or <strong><em>corner damping</em></strong> 
        to denote the pressure of the opposed blades at the corners, which causes 
        the tip aperture to assume a compound curve.)</p>
      <p align="left">If the rails on the given straight-sided reed are made concave, 
        the resulting reed will have less internal volume. This will dictate that 
        more compliance be added elsewhere in the reed design, if a proper total 
        vibrational size is to be maintained. (The concave rails also result in 
        more damping of the tip [fig. 9c].) </p>

      <p align="center"><em><font size="-1">Fig. 9c. A bassoon reed with concave 
        rails has a more severe compound curve at the aperture.</font></em></p>
      <p align="left"> The <strong><em>collar</em></strong> of the bassoon reed 
        (the bark that extends above the first wire) may in one sense be considered 
        part of the block that immobilizes one end of the vibrating blade. But 
        the collar is not massive enough to remain immobile itself, so this effect 
        is mitigated. The collar plays other roles, however. (We cannot add a 
        collar to an existing reed that lacks one, but let us speak theoretically 
        of doing so.) Adding mass to the back end of a given reed (that is, converting 
        part of its scraped blade into an unscraped collar) has at least two countervailing 
        effects. It (a) increases cross-section near the clamped end, which lessens 
        the compliance of the blades. It also (b) increases tension on the tip 
        aperture, making it rounder and more open. This increases internal volume, 
        which helps to offset the reduced compliance described in (a).</p>

        Vibration of a Three-Dimensional Reed: Effects of Profile, Forming and

      <p align="left">The third dimension of our reed model is that of thickness. 
        Whereas the blade of a bassoon reed widens towards the tip in the second 
        dimension, it narrows towards the tip in the third dimension. This latter 
        thinning towards the tip is essential in allowing a suction that completes 
        the oscillation cycle of the bassoon reed. Fairly thick tips are not unknown, 
        but they often require a thicker gouge (which places a softer, pithier 
        stratum of cane at the tip) or softer cane altogether, or some other mitigating 
        factor. The necessary balance of stiffness and flexibility (that is, a 
        suitable compliance) in the blades imposes operating limits in the third 
        dimension of the reed, especially in the 1 to 2 mm closest to the tip.</p>

      <p align="left">Above we discussed the basic effects of the shape of a reed&#8217;s 
        blades (that is, width, or the second dimension). But these were confined 
        to an ideal or theoretical realm. In practice, a two-dimensional piece 
        of gouged and shaped cane, upon being profiled, formed and scraped by 
        the reed maker, undergoes certain deformations of its second dimension 
        (width). These deformations of the width by introduction of the third 
        dimension are relatively minor, but they are predictable, and worth enumerating 
        here.</p>
      <p align="left"><em><strong>The blades of the reed.</strong></em> The two-dimensional 
        blade shape is deformed during the forming process, the basic principle 
        being that the two-dimensional flare becomes exaggerated. The tip shrinks 
        least, while further from the tip, the shape loses more and more of its 
        two-dimensional width. A straight-sided blade remains straight, but assumes 
        a greater angle from the tube than before forming. A concave side becomes 
        mores concave. A convex side becomes less convex.</p>
      <p align="left"><em><strong>The tube.</strong></em> The tube portion of 
        the reed undergoes a straightforward transformation during the forming 
        process from rectangle to semi-cylinder. A tube that measures 8.5 mm at 
        the throat when flat will measure less after forming, perhaps 6 x 7.5 
        mm. The actual diminution of formed width depends on several factors: 
        cane hardness, gouge thickness, use of overlapping versus square seams, 
        the mandrel taper and depth of insertion, the tautness of wires upon forming, 
        and the presence or absence of bevels in the tube.</p>
      <p align="left">The point in the air stream at which the reed&#8217;s internal 
        cavity reaches its minimum diameter is called the <strong><em>throat</em></strong>. 
        This often is located where the reed tube begins, under the first wire, 
        but it may be lower. A throat below the first wire will decrease the reed&#8217;s 
        equivalent volume and increase suction in the fourth phase of the vibration 
        cycle. It will also tend to lessen the leverage of the second wire. (These 
        secondary effects are discussed below.) Beveled edges on various parts 
        of the tube seams have the same effect as analogous reductions in width 
        of the two-dimensional shape. For the reed maker, however, the difference 
        is a practical matter, as a pre-narrowed shaper may not be available.</p>
      <p align="left"><em><strong>Depth of the blade cavity.</strong></em> A thinner 
        profile or contour before forming will decrease the internal volume of 
        the formed blank and finished reed, as one reed maker pointed out.<a href="#note12"><font size="-1"><em>12</em></font></a> 
        This is because thinner blades take on a compound curvature, when viewed 
        in cross section (figs. 12a &#8211; 12b). </p>

      <p align="left"> Even if scraped to a similar thickness, a thicker-profile 
        reed will have less of this compound curve. Later wire adjustments cannot 
        completely erase the different <strong><em>strains</em></strong> that 
        contrasting profiles may introduce upon forming of the blank. As a general 
        principle, thinning the blades (by scraping, filing, or sanding) tends 
        to increase compliance of the reed. But in practice, thinning often goes 
        hand in hand with wire adjustments, making the question of resulting compliance 
        changes very complex.</p>
      <p align="left"><em><strong>Wires and leverage.</strong></em> Early bassoon 
        reeds, which had a relatively small tip-to-throat ratio, were often made 
        without fully adjustable wires. Sometimes only inflexible metal rings 
        were present. But as a reed&#8217;s tip-to-throat ratio grows larger, 
        wires become increasingly necessary to open the tip to a functional aperture. 
        An average reed for modern bassoon, after forming, has a tip-to-throat 
        ratio of about 2/1. An oboe reed, by contrast, has a tip-to-throat ratio 
        of about 7/5. The modern oboe staple is oval in cross section, which helps 
        maintain the desired tip aperture. </p>

        the reed tube creates special conditions in the clamping and <strong><em>constraint</em></strong> 
        of the blades. In one sense, the shape of the wires affects the geometry 
        of the blades, which is part of the thickness or radial dimension under 
        discussion here. But in practice, the geometry of the tube, wires, and 
        blades is closely bound up with the tension applied to the tip aperture. 
        Accordingly, we will take up discussion of the wire and tube shape in 
        our later consideration of tip tension, a fourth dimension.</p>

        The Air Stream of the Bassoon Reed</font></strong> </p>
      <p align="left"><em><strong>The transient states.</strong></em> The vibration 
        cycle described in our introduction to the four-phase cycle of the bassoon 
        reed is called the steady state oscillation. But the reed does not proceed 
        immediately from silence to the steady state. In the same way that instruments 
        (including the bassoon) pass through an initial transient and a decay 
        transient, the reed passes through transients going to and from the steady 
        state. During the initial transient, the reed makes the transition from 
        its own oscillation frequency (the crow) to a <strong><em>regime of oscillation</em></strong> 
        with the bassoon&#8217;s air column, in which the reed becomes &#8220;enslaved&#8221; 
        by the air column. Physicists know relatively little about the transient 
        states of the bassoon reed, but they know that they are important in giving 
        the bassoon its characteristic tone.<a href="#note13"><font size="-1"><em>13</em></font></a> 
        During the initial transient, the phase 2 inflation of the reed blades 
        is probably due to increased air pressure from the player&#8217;s air 
        stream, but this is not true once the steady state of oscillation begins.</p>
      <p align="left"><em><strong>The steady state.</strong></em> In its first 
        or static phase, the bassoon reed is at what a physicist would call atmospheric 
        pressure. When we begin to blow air into a reed (during the initial transient), 
        we raise the air pressure, causing the blades to &#8220;inflate,&#8221; 
        or open further (second phase). Air begins to pass through the reed tube. 
        Because the tube is narrower than the blades, the air accelerates, just 
        as water forced through a hose nozzle accelerates. The upstream pressure, 
        supplied by the player&#8217;s abdominal muscles, is above atmospheric, 
        a physicist would say. </p>
      <p align="left">This is an instance of a <strong><em>Bernoulli effect</em></strong>, 
        a physical force arising from a sudden narrowing of the air column: as 
        an air column narrows, the downstream pressure decreases, and the result 
        of this is that the air speed increases. The acceleration of air through 
        the reed tube creates a suction (or negative pressure), which causes the 
        blades to &#8220;deflate,&#8221; passing through the static position (third 
        phase), until the tip closes (fourth phase) (fig. 1). </p>

      <p align="left">Note that this suction-induced fourth phase is affected 
        by the geometry of the internal cavity between the reed&#8217;s blades. 
        The cross section of the internal cavity (when the reed is inflated, second 
        position) steadily decreases in area as one moves from the tip toward 
        the throat, owing to both the flare (or tip-to-tube ratio) and the second-phase 
        opening of the reed&#8217;s blades. These contribute to the Bernoulli 
        effect, which leads to the acceleration, and thus to the fourth-phase 
        closing of the reed tip.</p>
      <p align="left">We have arrived now at the interplay of the air stream and 
        the vibrating blades, and thus at the interaction of fluid and mechanical 
        forces in the bassoon reed. The player&#8217;s blowing and the consequent 
        suction-induced rebound are fluid forces, but tension and elasticity &#8211; 
        mechanical forces &#8211; are critical in allowing the reed blades to 
        return to the static position from phases 2 and 4. For the reed to &#8220;inflate&#8221; 
        and &#8220;deflate&#8221; properly (i.e., to move satisfactorily from 
        phase 1 to 2 and from phase 3 to 4, in both cases away from the static 
        position) the reed must be sufficiently flexible, or compliant. For the 
        reed to return to the static position (i.e., to move from phase 2 to 3 
        and from phase 4 to 1), it must be sufficiently stiff, or elastic. </p>
      <p align="left">The proper management of various types of Bernoulli-induced 
        suction is a matter of concern to the bassoonist and reed maker.<a href="#note14"><font size="-1"><em>14</em></font></a> 
        We can enumerate some of the practical aspects as follows.</p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">9. The narrower 
        and/or longer the reed tube, the faster the air stream, other factors 
        remaining unchanged. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">10. The wider 
        and/or shorter the reed tube, the slower the air stream, other factors 
        remaining unchanged</font></p>
      <p align="left">Note that great air speed is not a virtue in itself; the 
        virtue lies instead in the right amount of suction to keep the cycle going 
        smoothly, rather like the timing on a car engine. Use of a throat reamer 
        or increased reaming of the butt increases the internal diameter. A reed 
        with an overly narrow throat, or an overly long throat, may create too 
        much suction, so that the reed stays deflated too easily. In other words, 
        the reed can &#8220;close down&#8221; and refuse to continue vibrating, 
        especially if blown hard. Conversely, an overly wide or overly short throat 
        can make the reed feel reluctant to vibrate, because too little suction 
        is generated to continue the cycle smoothly. </p>
      <p align="left">The effect of the reed tube&#8217;s dimensions upon Bernoulli-induced 
        suction is more important than their effect on tuning; changes in the 
        suction probably contribute to any timbral difference that bassoonists 
        perceive as being related to tube dimensions. </p>
      <p align="left"><em><strong>Turbulence.</strong></em> Blunt (square) edges 
        and rough surfaces in an air column are likely to give rise to <strong><em>turbulence</em></strong>, 
        consisting of tiny eddies or <strong><em>vortices</em></strong>. Turbulence 
        interferes with the <strong><em>streamline</em></strong> flow of the air 
        column, leading to <strong><em>white noise</em></strong> and possibly 
        to erratic cycling of the reed.<a href="#note15"><font size="-1"><em>15</em></font></a> 
        Streamlining the reed tip helps minimize turbulence. Sudden constrictions 
        in the air column also tend to create turbulence. Protruding cane fibers 
        in the tube are one possible source of such a constriction; a crimped 
        or overly thick bocal tip is another.</p>

      <p align="left"><strong><a name="section7"></a><font size="+1">7. A Fourth 
        Dimension of Reed Vibration: The Effect of Tip Tension</font></strong></p>
      <p align="left">The tip aperture of the bassoon reed is under tension, giving 
        it some of the qualities of a vibrating membrane. The tensional force 
        results primarily from the deformation of the cane&#8217;s original circumference 
        into a flatter ellipse (the tip aperture). We will call this force <strong><em>tip 
        tension</em></strong>, since it manifests itself at the reed&#8217;s tip 
        aperture. It is distinct from elasticity in the three familiar dimensions 
        we discussed above. Tip tension is present even in unwired double reeds, 
        such as oboe reeds; differing ratios of circumference to tip width will 
        yield different degrees of tension in the tip aperture. A secondary source 
        of tip tension is the reed tube, a tighter ellipse into which the circumference 
        is forced. Deformation of the tube by means of the upper two wires, as 
        discussed below, affects the tip aperture in predictable ways.</p>
      <p align="left"><em><strong>The curved gouge.</strong></em> The particular 
        size of cane tube chosen for bassoon cane is a reasonable compromise between 
        the flatter arc of the reed tip and the rounder tube of finished reed, 
        which is warped to a tiny arc by the forming process (figs. 13a &#8211; 
        13c). </p>

      <p align="left"> Bassoon cane tubes typically measure 22-24 mm in outside 
        diameter. When split, they retain this arc. When the cane is gouged, however, 
        the arc becomes flexible. If soaked for several days and allowed to dry 
        untouched, the cane often cups to a smaller arc, especially if gouged 
        very thin. The profiling process seems to lessen the cupping force, confirming 
        that the bark is the source of this cupping or tension. Most reed makers 
        favor an elliptical gouge, which tends to exaggerate the rounding of the 
        tip aperture, since the corners are of harder cane.</p>
      <p align="left"><em><strong>The tip aperture.</strong></em> It is noteworthy 
        that makers of oboe reeds, who often use no adjustment wires, regularly 
        choose from a variety of cane diameters, with the goal of controlling 
        the shape of the tip aperture. One supplier, for example, offers to sort 
        oboe tubes in .50 mm increments, from 9.5-11.25 mm. The smaller the original 
        cane circumference, the greater its deformation after forming the reed, 
        and the greater the tension applied to the tip. </p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">11. The smaller 
        the cane diameter, the more open the tip aperture, all other design factors 
        remaining constant.</font> </p>
      <p align="left">The more bark present in a reed blade, the stronger the 
        effect of tip tension upon the tip aperture. The presence of a collar 
        above the first wire, as discussed above, also helps open the tip aperture. 
        When reeds are made in a historical style (with a short scrape and, often, 
        a graduated gouge), the bark portion of the blade is long enough to maintain 
        the tip aperture, even in the absence of a heart in the scraped portion.</p>
      <p align="left"><em><strong>Wire adjustments and placement.</strong></em> 
        For purposes of discussion, let us assume that a reed has a round tube 
        wound in a perfectly circular ligature of snugly fitting wires, and blades 
        thin and moistened enough to be suitable for vibration and music-making. 
        Deformation of the first wire will have a direct effect on the tip aperture.

      <p align="left">Because the first wire is <strong><em>axial</em></strong> 
        with the center of the blade&#8217;s tip, deformations of it from the

      </p>
      <p align="left">By virtue of its position closest to the blades, the first 
        wire also acts as a fulcrum, inverting the respective actions of the second 
        wire. Control of the tip aperture via this fulcrum by deformation of the 
        second wire is occasionally referred to in this discussion as leverage. 
        Bassoonists commonly refer to deformations of the wires as <strong> <em>adjustments</em></strong>, 
        and so shall we.</p>

      <p align="left">The effects of the second wire deformation are transmitted 
        from beyond the first wire, so they tend to have a secondary effect on 
        the tip. As long as the first wire continues to influence the axial portion 
        (the center) of the tip aperture, deformation of the second wire is most 
        noticeable in the <strong><em>off-axis</em></strong> portions of the tip 
        (the corners). In practice, the two wires are adjusted in tandem, by trial 
        and error, until the desired aperture is obtained.</p>
      <p align="left">The wire adjustment and leverage model is limited in an 
        important sense by the mutual <strong><em>constraint</em></strong> of 
        the opposed blades. The opposed corners of the two blades touch or nearly 
        touch when the reed is in the static position (depending on the design 
        and the wire adjustments). This touching obviously limits the movement 
        of each blade, causing vibration to end quickly after each cycle. In other 
        words, this built-in constraint is a major source of <strong><em>damping</em></strong>. 
        The opposed corners separate in phase 2, when the reed is &#8220;inflated,&#8221; 
        but are touching or nearly so in the other three phases. This structural 
        damping of the reed design is always present, but wire adjustments allow 
        the player to increase or decrease it to some extent. </p>
      <p align="left">There must be enough separation between wires 1 and 2 for 
        the wire leverage to take effect. But if there is too much separation 
        between these two wires, the cane will not transmit the rounding or flattening, 
        especially if the cane is soft. Harder cane will transmit wire leverage 
        further than softer cane, in both blade and tube. Increased slackness 
        of the two wires will diminish or even nullify the effect of wire deformations.</p>

      <p align="left"><strong><font size="+1"><a name="section8"></a>8. The Embouchure&#8217;s 
        Effect on Vibration</font></strong></p>
      <p align="left">So far we have largely been discussing <strong><em>generation</em></strong>, 
        or the positive aspect of vibration. We have briefly referred to <strong><em>damping</em></strong>, 
        which is the stifling of vibration. A bassoon&#8217;s reed is always damped 
        in the sense that the constraint imposed by the two opposed blades limits 
        their travel or vibration. A reed may be further damped by other design 
        factors or by wire adjustments, as we have noted. It may also be damped 
        by action of the player&#8217;s lip pressure, jaw pressure, and oral cavity. 
      </p>
      <p align="left">Acousticians have frequently lumped the last three together 
        under the heading of <strong><em>lip damping</em></strong>. These techniques 
        have the important function of singling out a particular <strong><em>resonance 
        peak</em></strong>, while suppressing other ones. It is interesting to 
        note that the bassoon, unlike the clarinet, can be played, in a very crude 
        way, without any reliance on lip damping. Gripping the reed with the lips 
        &#8220;too far onto the reed,&#8221; between wire 1 and wire 2, the player 
        can produce the entire first register (BB-flat to f), albeit with a raw 
        tone quality and little control of volume. But a command of lip damping 
        techniques (in other words, a well-developed <strong><em>embouchure</em></strong>) 
        is essential for artistic playing. By this means the bassoonist is able 
        to achieve maximum resonance for a given pitch; this is partly because 
        the lips themselves begin to vibrate along with the reed.<a href="#note16"><font size="-1"><em>16</em></font></a> 
        Lip damping is also important in allowing the player to stabilize the 
        pitch level during changes in dynamics. </p>
      <p align="left">Before the adoption of the whisper vent (late 18th to early 
        20th century), the middle register of the bassoon had virtually identical 
        fingerings to the lower register; only by a change in lip damping was 
        the first or second octave chosen. A skilled use of lip damping techniques 
        helps the bassoonist avoid squawks or cracked notes, which are unwanted 
        <strong><em>response modes</em></strong>, often an octave higher or lower 
        than the intended pitch. The closer the lips are to the tip of the blades, 
        the greater the damping, because the travel of the blades is at a maximum 
        at the tip. </p>
      <p align="left">Some bassoonists intuitively shape the oral cavity to improve 
        timbre and tuning. Some others have developed a system of &#8220;vowel 
        visualization&#8221; techniques, shaping the vocal cavity as they would 
        in speaking or singing a variety of vowel sounds. </p>
      <p align="left">The bassoonist may also use jaw pressure to close the reed 
        tip aperture to a greater or lesser extent. Partly closing the reed tip 
        aperture through lip pressure (or biting) has the effect of reducing the 
        internal volume of the reed. Conversely, lowering the jaw will allow the 
        aperture to reach maximum size, increasing the internal volume.<a href="#note17"><font size="-1"><em>17</em></font></a></p>

      <p align="left"><strong><font size="+1"><a name="section9"></a>9. Conclusions</font></strong></p>
      <p align="left">The clamped-free bar model has allowed us to relate many 
        characteristics of the vibrating bassoon reed to a set of well-understood 
        physical principles. There is no need to repeat here the many characteristics 
        of reed design noted in italics during the preceding discussion. But we 
        may stress again that certain design choices increase the reed&#8217;s 
        compliance; certain obverse choices lower the compliance. A proper vibrational 
        size &#8211; resulting from a complementary relationship of compliance 
        and static size &#8211; is essential to the proper functioning of a bassoon 
        reed. In the simplest of terms, lower compliance makes for good high-register 
        response and a resistant crow, while the higher compliance makes for good 
        low-register response and an easy crow. Most of these design choices are 
        fairly simple to understand in isolation, but their mutual interactions 
        in a vibrating reed can be very complex. The successful combination of 
        design choices is both the m&eacute;tier of the reed maker and a fitting 
        area of future study by acoustic physicists.</p>
      <p align="left">The reed maker checks the size, shape, and resistance of 
        the tip aperture first in attempting to finish or adjust a reed that is 
        not quite satisfactory. From our discussion, it is clear that the tip 
        aperture is also of fundamental importance in the reed&#8217;s physics. 
        The aperture must be flexible enough to depart from its static position, 
        inflating in the second phase and deflating in the fourth phase of the 
        vibrational cycle. Yet is must have enough restoring force (elasticity) 
        to return to the static position in the first and third phases.</p>
      <p align="left">The aperture of the static tip is controlled by the tip-to-throat 
        ratio, the finished blade length, and the scrape of the tip, and also 
        by the placement, tautness, and deformation of the adjustment wires. Additional 
        forces control the movement of the vibrating reed tip: elasticity (a force 
        of the third or radial dimension of the cane), tip tension (derived from 
        the fourth or circumferential dimension of the cane), and the suction 
        resulting from the narrowing of the air stream.</p>
      <p align="left">In a well-adjusted reed, third- and fourth-dimensional forces 
        &#8211; elasticity and tension, respectively &#8211; will be present in 
        a complementary relationship. The stiffer the cane present in a reed &#8211; 
        whether through cane selection, gouge thickness, gouge radius, collar 
        length, thickness of scrape &#8211; the stronger the fourth-dimensional 
        force (tension) will be, and the less need for wire adjustment. Conversely, 
        the less elastic the cane present, in the respects enumerated above, the 
        weaker will be the effect of tension upon the tip aperture, and the greater 
        the need for wire adjustment. Soft cane may yield a smaller throat, resulting 
        in increased suction and a stronger force toward deflation (fourth phase).

      <p align="left">All these physical forces, which work together to establish 
        the reed&#8217;s vibration, may be actively managed in the design of reeds 
        of widely varied characteristics, suitable to the individual needs of 
        players. The bassoonist who understands this will have a valuable advantage 
        in producing and improving the reeds that bring his or her instrument 
        to musical life.</p>

      <p align="left">I am grateful to two colleagues who read this article in 
        draft and made numerous useful suggestions. Donald J. Casodante, who wrote 
        a dissertation about the clarinet reed, was a rich source of insights 
        about the state of research in reed physics and botany. Frank A. Morelli, 
        the well-known performer and teacher, ably represented the bassoonist&#8217;s 
        point of view. </p>

        <strong>3.</strong><a name="note3"></a> Botanically speaking, only trees 
        can have bark; the outer layer of Arundo donax is properly called the 
        epidermis or sclerenchyma. Bassoonists virtually never use either of these 
        terms, however; they almost invariably call the outer layer &#8220;bark.&#8221; 
        In deference to these readers, I will follow the customary (if unscientific) 
        usage here.<br>
        <strong>4.</strong><a name="note4"></a> Strictly speaking, the cane of 
        the bassoon reed, Arundo donax, is a viscoelastic material, having qualities 
        of both a fluid and a solid. For a detailed explanation, see Donald J. 
        Casadonte, &#8220;The Clarinet Reed: An Introduction to its Biology, Chemistry, 
        and Physics&#8221; (D.M.A. diss: The Ohio State University, 1995), 279-83. 
        In this article, however, we will be focusing on the elastic characteristics 
        of its solid aspect. <br>

        Reed&#8221;, 344; Donald J. Casadonte, personal communication, March 2003.<br>
        <strong>6.</strong><a name="note6"></a> Cornelis Johannes Nederveen, Acoustical 
        Aspects of Woodwind Instruments, revised ed. (DeKalb, Illinois: Northern 
        Illinois University Press, 1998), 5, likened compliance to the elongation 
        of a spring (in an analogous model of vibration). He pointed out that 
        in the case of a bar clamped at one end, &#8220;compliance and mass &#8230; 
        are distributed along the whole vibrating system.&#8221; This is also 
        true of the vibrating blade of the bassoon reed. <br>
        <strong>7.</strong><a name="note7"></a> &#8220;In reed-blown instruments 
        the reed properties, such as size, shape, compliance and damping, are 
        essential for proper tuning. The reed compliance causes a lowering of 
        the frequency. In conical instruments, the reed compliance has the same 
        effect as a [clarinet] mouthpiece cavity, and therefore, it has an important 
        function in keeping the upper register in tune with the lower one.&#8221; 
        Nederveen, Acoustical Aspects, 97.<br>
        <strong>8.</strong><a name="note8"></a> Bassoonists often use the term 
        &#8220;free-blowing&#8221; to describe a reed that is very compliant, 
        and &#8220;resistant&#8221; to describe a reed that is less compliant. 
        I have avoided use of the term resistance in this paper, because its specific 
        physical meaning is not an antonym for compliance. Moreover, bassoonists 
        commonly use the single term resistance to describe effects due variously 
        to damping and to blade stiffness. To the player, these may seem related, 
        but to the physicist, they are quite separate.<br>

        fork will therefore directly as the thickness of the prongs &#8230; and 
        inversely as the square of the length of the prongs.&#8221; Encyclopedia

        &amp; Harmony (Garden City, New York: Anchor Books, 1960), 161-63, discusses 
        contrasting &#8220;vibration recipes&#8221; (tonal spectra) that result 
        from different lengths of phase 2, relative to the overall cycle length. 
        The specific implications of this topic for reed design are an important 
        subject for future reed research.<br>
        <strong>15.</strong><a name="note15"></a> &#8220;Rounding of reed edges 
        in double-reed instruments and of edges of narrow tube entrances has been 
        found to influence playing: such smoothing reduces the contraction of 
        the free jet and consequently the turbulent dissipation losses.&#8221; 
        Nederveen, Acoustical Aspects, 120. By &#8220;rounding of edges,&#8221; 
        Nederveen was apparently referring to streamlining the outer surfaces 
        of the tip aperture. The reed maker or player commonly does this with 
        a knife, file, or fine sandpaper.<br>

        <strong>17.</strong><a name="note17"></a> Smith argued that the bassoonist 
        must become especially adept at damping techniques in order to produce 
        a range of three-and-a-half octaves using a single tone generator. Smith, 
        Reed Design, 45.</p>
