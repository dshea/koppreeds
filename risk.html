        <p align="left">For most double-reed players, the term &#8220;risk management&#8221; 
          conjures up thoughts of insurance policies, or investment strategies 
          &#8211; topics seemingly remote from our musical agendas. Yet it can 
          be useful to think of reed making in analogous terms. Who among us would 
          not like a little insurance policy on each reed, or a strategy for reed 
          making intended to maximize our &#8220;return on investment&#8221; of 
          time, materials, and effort? Especially when the cost for this insurance 
          is little or nothing?<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left"> &#8220;But I&#8217;m not a financial type,&#8221; you 
          say. &#8220;I don&#8217;t like hearing about insurance policies,&#8221; 
          you protest. Well, I&#8217;m with you. But far outside the fields of 
          insurance and investments, a wide variety of manufacturers adopted strategies 
          of risk management long ago. Time, tools, materials, and effort are 
          managed on a daily basis, with a goal of controlling both expenditures 
          and product quality. Take, for example, the machinist, a worker whose 
          craft clearly parallels ours as reed makers. A machinist, or machine 
          tool operator, crafts items, often small and moving ones, over and over, 
          just as we do. The objects may be metal parts for automobiles, or wooden 
          rungs for ladders or chairs, or gemstones for jewelry. The machine tool 
          may be power-driven or not, but it will have certain advantages over 
          hand tools (which we will discuss below).<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">Thus a machinist may sometimes be called an auto worker, 
          a millwright, or a lapidary, even though the tasks undertaken are closely 
          analogous to one another. In fact, some of us reed makers use gouging 
          or profiling machines, which are themselves machine tools. So we are 
          sometimes machinists ourselves. But few of us have intensive or systematic 
          training in this broad field. So it is instructive to examine some of 
          the steps the machinist takes to avoid waste and variation. Many of 
          the same principles can be borrowed or adapted, at little or no cost, 
          by the reed maker who works only with hand tools.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">Let&#8217;s start with a simple, general example, and 
          then move on to more specific examples. I don&#8217;t claim that any 
          of the following techniques is the only possible way to complete the 
          task successfully. But each technique works reliably, and can serve 
          as a useful illustration of the risk management process at work.<br>
          <a href="#beginning">[Top]</a></p>
        <p align="left"><strong><font size="+1"><a name="section1"></a>Example 
          1: Holding the workpiece (the reed, that is)</font></strong><br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">Before the invention (or adoption) of the plaque (perhaps 
          first seen in Brod&#8217;s oboe method of ca. 1826), the reed maker 
          held the reed in the palm of his hand for knife work. The tip rested 
          against the fleshy heel of the palm, while the butt was held between 
          the thumb and index finger. (Much of the slicing or scraping was done 
          before the tip was opened.) (See fig. 1)<br>
        </p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images/risk/risk.fig.1.JPG" class="figure1"> 
        </p>
        <p align="center">Fig. 1. Before the plaque came into use, the reed maker 
          often held the tip of the reed against the flesh of the palm for working.</p>
        <p align="left">Once the plaque came into use, each reed blade was supported 
          from within, providing a flat surface and a measure of safety to the 
          reed scraper. Now the mandrel (in earlier times used only in the forming 
          operation) could also be used to steady the reed during the scraping 
          operation. (See fig. 2) All these factors made for a safer and more 
          effective scraping operation.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images/risk/risk.fig.2.JPG" class="figure1"> 
        </p>
        <p align="center">Fig. 2. The plaque provides support under the reed&#8217;s 
          blades, lessening the risk of crushing them while working. The mandrel 
          provides a steady grip for the reed maker.</p>
        <p align="left">Some reed makers improve on this standard method of holding 
          the reed by simply resting the holding hand against the desk or the 
          maker&#8217;s thigh. Either one of these improved postures stabilizes 
          the reed/plaque/mandrel, making errors incrementally less likely and 
          greatly reducing fatigue in the player&#8217;s holding arm. (Aside from 
          reducing risk to the reed, this improved arm posture also reduces the 
          risk of tendinitis, a common complaint of both wind players and reed 
          makers).<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">A machinist would try to avoid holding the workpiece (as 
          any material undergoing work, or machine-tooling, is called) in the 
          unsupported hand. The machinist might instead use some sort of support 
          for the workpiece; it might be called a clamp, a jig, or a rest, depending 
          on the nature of the support and the jargon within the machinist&#8217;s 
          special field. We can approximate the machinist&#8217;s technique by 
          simply clamping the holding mandrel in a small vise. The vise can be 
          mounted to the reed maker&#8217;s desk permanently, or on a wooden block 
          that is large enough to provide stability, yet light enough to be portable. 
          (See fig. 3) Some vises intended for temporary mounting have a built-in 
          screw for quick installation and removal. Many such vises, unfortunately, 
          are not immediately suitable for the typical reed desk because their 
          jaws run parallel to the desk edge, thus positioning the mandrel at 
          an awkward angle to the reed maker.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images/risk/risk.fig.3.JPG" class="figure1"> 
        </p>
        <p align="center">Fig. 3. The holding mandrel can be held by a small vise, 
          which can itself be mounted on a stable but moveable block.</p>
        <p align="left">A small vise will cost as much as a large pizza, and the 
          mandrel handle may eventually become worn by the teeth of the vise jaws, 
          but there is no other downside to this technique. And it has surprising 
          advantages. The off hand (the left, for right-handed reed makers) is 
          suddenly freed up, so that reed work is less fatiguing. In fact, the 
          off hand can be put to work in ways that reduce fatigue on the &#8220;good&#8221; 
          hand. It can steady the knife or file (more about this later), and it 
          can easily learn to use sandpaper. Scraping with the off hand is a tall 
          order and one I&#8217;ve never mastered, but someone more ambidextrous 
          than me will succeed in doing so.<br>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div align="left">We may summarize these issues as follows:</div>
      <blockquote> 
        <div align="left"> 
          <p><strong>Risk:</strong> The workpiece (reed) may slip, leading to 
            mis-scraping.<br>
            <strong>Management:</strong> Rest the holding hand against desk or 
            thigh.<br>
          </p>
          <p><strong>Risk:</strong> Overuse of the holding hand may lead to fatigue 
            or tendinitis.<br>
            <strong>Management:</strong> Clamp the holding mandrel in a vise.<br>
          </p>
        </div>
      </blockquote>
      <div align="left"> 
        <p>Our next example demonstrates some of the criteria used in choosing 
          the optimum tool for a task.</p>
        <p><a href="#beginning">[Top]</a></p>
        <p><strong><font size="+1"><a name="section2"></a>Example 2: Cutting the 
          collar on a bassoon reed</font></strong><br>
        </p>
        <p> The collar of a bassoon reed, if present, is an unremoved bit of rind 
          (or &#8220;bark&#8221; or epidermis) that projects above the first wire. 
          (Some styles of bassoon reed do not employ a collar.) If a noticeable 
          &#8220;step&#8221; between the collar and the blade surface of the reed 
          is desired, the task of creating the step can be time-consuming or risky, 
          or both. Some players are reluctant even to attempt the creation of 
          a collar and step, because they&#8217;re afraid of botching the job. 
          This is a missed opportunity, because the step can have a noticeable 
          effect on the reed&#8217;s sound and response.<br>
        </p>
        <p>Once again, the machinist has a technique that we can borrow. It is 
          common for machine tools to have a &#8220;guide&#8221; of some sort, 
          a means of directing the travel of the tool. The guide minimizes risk 
          by preventing the tool from going where it is not intended to go. The 
          bassoon reed maker can easily approximate the function of a machinist&#8217;s 
          guide by using the thumb of the off hand. (To avoid ambiguity, I&#8217;m 
          going to use compass directions to refer to the necessary motions; &#8220;north&#8221; 
          is upward, &#8220;east&#8221; is rightward, etc. &#8220;Inward,&#8221; 
          however, means into the workpiece, and usually away from the reed maker.) 
          <br>
        </p>
        <p>Either a single-edge razor blade or a fine-edge knife (double hollow-ground, 
          for example) is sharp enough to score the rind (that is, to make an 
          inward cut to about the desired depth). In one sense, the knife is preferable 
          in that the length of its handle serves as a visual aid while the maker 
          attempts to cut exactly parallel to the nearby first wire. That is, 
          the length helps the maker avoid a &#8220;yawing&#8221; error. In either 
          case, you, the maker, can use the thumb of the off hand as a guide: 
          simply position the off thumb approximately on top of the first wire, 
          adjusting the placement so that the extremity of the nail or flesh is 
          touching the imaginary line you wish to score. (See fig. 4) </p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images/risk/risk.fig.4.JPG" class="figure1"></p>
        <p align="center">Fig. 4. The thumb nail of the off hand is positioned 
          touching the line where the collar step will be created.</p>
        <p>Then bring the blade lightly into contact with the rind of the reed. 
          Next, rock the blade back and forth slowly on the line, using the thumb 
          as guide to prevent slippage, and applying inward pressure until you 
          feel the desired depth has been reached. (See fig. 5)<br>
        </p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images/risk/risk.fig.5.JPG" class="figure1"> 
        </p>
        <p align="center">Fig. 5. A thin knife is steadied against the thumb nail, 
          making an accurate scoring cut more likely. </p>
        <p>The next step is to cut southward (that is, back toward the scored 
          line), to remove the excess cane (the &#8220;chip,&#8221; as the machinist 
          would call it). One risk here is that the blade, being very sharp, will 
          travel further than the maker wishes &#8211; past the scored line. It&#8217;s 
          a good time to use a blunter knife, such as a single-bevel knife. Even 
          if such a knife is properly sharpened, it is designed as a less acute 
          wedge; this blunter wedge will be sharp enough to make the cut, and 
          yet it will be easier to control. The maker can increase the control 
          still further by bracing the thumb of the good hand against the thumb 
          of the off hand, which is wrapped securely around the mandrel. (See 
          fig. 6) The biomechanical result of this is that the motion is necessarily 
          transferred away from the shoulder and elbow, and to the palm and wrist 
          muscles, which are much better trained in fine motor movements.</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images/risk/risk.fig.6.JPG" class="figure1"></p>
        <p align="center">Fig. 6. The reed maker uses a single-bevel knife to 
          remove the chip. When cutting in this direction, the thumb of the knife 
          hand is braced by the thumb of the other hand, which is itself steadied 
          by a grip on the holding mandrel.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">In the third step, the maker uses a blade (preferably 
          the single-bevel knife, which is less likely to travel too deeply) to 
          cut inward again at the scoring line. This is done several times along 
          the line, until most of the chip has been removed. <br>
          The final task is to use a file to clean up the step, leaving it smooth, 
          clean, and right-angled. A good tool for this task is an extra-narrow 
          pillar file, so called because it can be used to create a pillar (a 
          rectangular solid that rises up out of the main body of a workpiece). 
          A pillar file has two desirable characteristics for this sort of task: 
          it has a straight body (which, properly used, will preserve the straight 
          line you created by scoring and chip removal) and &#8220;safe&#8221; 
          edges on the non-cutting sides of the file. (If your file has a safe 
          edge, you&#8217;ll be filing only inward; without a safe edge, you&#8217;ll 
          be filing both inward and southward, thereby disturbing the line you 
          scored and chipped out.) In addition, a longer file makes any yawing 
          more obvious to the eye, thereby reducing the likelihood of error. (See. 
          fig. 7)</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images/risk/risk.fig.7.JPG" class="figure1"></p>
        <p align="center">Fig. 7. This extra-narrow pillar file, useful for cleaning 
          out the collar step, has both a cutting surface (shown below) and a 
          safe surface (shown above).<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">The risk analysis and management of this operation is 
          a little more detailed than the previous example:</p>
      </div>
      <blockquote> 
        <div align="left"> 
          <p><strong>Risk:</strong> The scoring blade will yaw, creating a slanted 
            line for the collar.<br>
            <strong>Management:</strong> Use the thumb of the off hand as a guide 
            for the blade. Observe the knife handle, which protracts any yaw error, 
            making it more obvious. <br>
          </p>
          <p><strong>Risk:</strong> The blade will travel too far &#8220;south,&#8221; 
            undercutting the collar.<br>
            <strong>Management:</strong> Use a blunter-shaped knife for southward 
            cutting, such as a single-bevel knife. Brace the cutting hand against 
            the off hand, increasing control of the tool.<br>
          </p>
          <p><strong>Risk:</strong> A tapered file will create a curved collar

        <p>Our next example illustrates how machinists break down a complex task 
          into a series of smaller, simpler tasks.<br>

        <p>We are fortunate, in modern times, to have many shapers (or templates, 
          as a machinist would call them) available, some one of which will usually 
          yield a reed of the desired proportions. But occasions sometimes arise 
          when the tip of a reed&#8217;s blades is wider than we wish. Attempting 
          to narrow it can be treacherous, as many of us can attest from personal 
          experience. Let us consider how a machinist would approach this task. 
          (Let&#8217;s focus here on creating straight rails or sides &#8211; 
          curved rails are much riskier.) <br>
        </p>
        <p>One reason the narrowing operation is treacherous is because the reed&#8217;s 
          material &#8211; the cane &#8211; has a strong lengthwise grain. When 
          we wish to create a narrower tip, we are attempting to create a diagonal 
          line across the grain, which is a risky proposition. The machinist, 
          knowing this, might begin by turning the grain direction to his advantage. 
          The first step is to hold the reed on a mandrel, with the tip pointing 
          toward your chest. Then select the point on the rail &#8220;due north&#8221; 
          of the desired new tip width. Then, using a sharp blade, slice along 
          the grain, toward your chest. (See fig. 8) This is a fairly safe and 
          predictable operation, because the natural tendency of the cane is to 
          &#8220;rip,&#8221; or split along its grain. </p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images/risk/risk.fig.8.JPG" class="figure1"></p>
        <p align="center">Fig. 8. In narrowing a reed tip, the maker uses a thin 
          knife blade to &#8220;rip&#8221; along the grain.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">The resulting shape has a convex corner. (See fig. 9) 
        </p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images/risk/risk.fig.9.JPG" class="figure1"></p>
        <p align="center">Fig. 9. After ripping, the resulting shape has a small 
          convex corner (right) that must be filed away.</p>
        <p align="left">We want to remove this corner by using a file. This is 
          a good time to choose a large file. The wider the file, the less chance 
          there is of filing too deeply into the rail (in the east or west dimension), 
          because the large file spans all of the convexity (the portion to be 
          removed). It&#8217;s simply a matter of choosing the right angle of 
          address, and then filing until the convexity is gone. Otherwise, with 
          a narrow file, the maker is forced to work one part of the convexity, 
          then another, then return to the first part, etc., all the while relying 
          on his visual impression to avoid excessive filing. In this instance, 
          using the larger tool makes for a simple (and speedy) operation, while 
          using a smaller tool would make for a complex (and thus riskier) operation.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="left">One other effective technique is to grip the reed blades 
          from top and bottom near the convexity, pinching the two blades firmly 
          shut while filing. (See fig. 10) </p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images/risk/risk.fig.10.JPG" class="figure1"></p>
        <p align="center">Fig. 10. While filing away the convexity, the reed maker 
          grips both reed blades, pinching them securely shut so that the file 
          does not tear them.</p>
        <p align="left">This lends stability to the workpiece (the reed), lessening 
          the chance that one blade will be flexed open and damaged by the file.<br>

        <p>Theorists of workmanship distinguish between &#8220;workmanship of 
          risk&#8221; and &#8220;workmanship of certainty.&#8221; (See, for example, 
          David Pye, The Nature and Art of Workmanship, rev. ed. (Bethel, Connecticut: 
          Cambium Press, 1968), 20-24.) In the first category, more skill and 
          judgment are demanded of the worker, because there is a large possibility 
          of disastrous error. In the second category, less skill and judgment 
          are demanded, because the work techniques have been designed to minimize 
          risk. We may imagine a continuous scale of risk/certainty, with different 
          tasks falling at various points along the scale. (See fig. 11)</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="center"><img id="figure11" src="images/risk/risk.fig.11.png"></p>
        <p align="center">Fig. 11. Some reed making tasks have a high risk of 
          disastrous error, while others have little or none. They may be ranked 
          along a scale between these two extremes. (After David Pye, The Nature 
          and Art of Workmanship.)</p>
        <p><br>
          Each of the management techniques suggested above is designed to lower 
          the risk inherent in the task described &#8211; to move it further to 
          the right on the scale. We haven&#8217;t spoken here of doing away with 
          risk altogether, because that it often impossible for hand work. Instead, 
          we speak of risk management, because we are simply improving our chances 
          of success a little by borrowing some techniques from our colleagues 
          the machinists. <br>
        </p>
        <p>The most valuable insight we can gain from this discussion is not any 
          one suggested technique. Instead, it&#8217;s a new attitude (new to 
          most of us non-machinists, at least) toward reed-making tasks, in which 
          we automatically ask, &#8220;What could go wrong here, when I attempt 
          to ....&#8221; And we finish the sentence by naming any reed-making 
          task that we face, old or new. In other words, we analyze the operation 
          by identifying the potential risks. Then we attempt to imagine a technique 
          that will minimize the risk of the task. In other words, we begin to 
          manage the risk. <br>
        </p>
        <p>Far from making a neurotic doubter out of the reed maker, habitual 
          risk management has a liberating effect: the maker is less afraid to 
          attempt new or delicate operations, because the various risks can always 
          be managed, if not always eliminated. <br>
        </p>
        <p>This approach to reed work courts success by simplifying all the component 
          tasks. If you can break down the work into a series of &#8220;no-brainer&#8221; 
          tasks, then you&#8217;ve gained a major advantage in reed making. This 
          is particularly important in an endeavor where a tenth of a millimeter 
          (or a hundredth of an inch) can make a critical difference in the product 
          quality &#8211; in the performance characteristics of the reed.<br>
        </p>
        <p>We haven&#8217;t said anything here about reed design, only about manufacturing 
          techniques. But the reed maker who can routinely turn out reeds with 
          a high degree of consistency can then &#8211; and only then &#8211; 
          make controlled experiments with design variations. The differences 
          heard and felt in the new reed design will be attributable to the reed 
          design itself, not to accidents in the execution of the design. In other 
          words, you can take much of the bad luck out of the reed making process 
          by this systematic dumbing-down of tasks. And what could be smarter?<br>
