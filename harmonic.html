    <p align="left">The fingering patterns of the bassoon&#8217;s upper register are 
      based on a characteristic of its bore called the pipe resonances. Acoustic physicists 
      have studied the pipe resonances of the Heckel- or German-system bassoon in 
      combination with the bocal, which is in fact the upper part of the bore. In 
      these investigations, the other components of the full acoustical system of 
      the bassoon &#8211; the reed and the player &#8211; are purposely ignored for 
      study purposes.<a href="#note1"><font size="-1"><em>1</em></font></a> (We will 
      compare the full-system resonances later in this article, however.) The pipe 
      resonances of the bassoon (hereafter understood to include the bocal) are important 
      to the performing bassoonist as the root cause of the seemingly arbitrary fingerings 
      in the upper register (that is, Eb4 and higher, plus a few alternate fingerings 
      at lower pitches). (See fig.1 for an explanation of pitch names.) </p>
    <p align="center"><img id="fig1" src="images/harmonic/Fig1.gif"> </p>
    <p align="center"><em>Figure 1. Explanation of pitch names, based on terminology 
      of the Acoustical Society of America.</em> </p>
    <p>A pipe open at one end will resonate when blown. If, for example, we blow across 
      the open end of an empty soda bottle, a fundamental pitch is produced. An increase 
      in blowing pressure will result in a higher &#8220;overblown&#8221; pitch. These 
      are the pipe resonances of the bottle cavity. If the bottle&#8217;s resonant 
      cavity is gradually reduced in size by partly filling it with water, the pitch 
      will rise.<a href="#note2"><font size="-1"><em>2</em></font></a> This reduction 
      is analogous to shortening the bassoon&#8217;s air column (pipe) by opening 
      tone holes to raise the pitch from Bb1 to F3 (open F). </p>
    <p>A pipe in the shape of a perfect cone will overblow harmonically &#8211; it 
      will produce an array of pipe resonances related to one another by a harmonic 
      ratio. That is, the higher resonance peaks (overtones) will be related to the 
      lowest peak (the fundamental) by whole-number ratios of frequency. Thus the 
      second peak (double the first peak&#8217;s frequency) will lie a perfect octave 
      above the first, the third peak (triple the first peak&#8217;s frequency) will 
      lie a perfect twelfth above the first, etc.<a href="#note3"><font size="-1"><em>3</em></font></a> 
      This, roughly speaking, is how F#3 and higher pitches are produced on the bassoon. 
    </p>
    <p>So far, so good, but the complications start now. The bassoon&#8217;s bore 
      is an imperfect cone in two respects. First, the cone is truncated (shortened) 
      at the small end, the reed substituting for the missing portion. Second, there 
      are many local perturbances (changes of slope) in the cone purposely introduced 
      by bassoon makers, the results of experiments to improve the tuning and tone 
      quality of the instrument.<a href="#note4"><font size="-1"><em>4</em></font></a> 
      As a result of these two sorts of imperfections, the pipe resonances of the 
      bassoon bore do not lie in a true harmonic relationship. Instead, the ratio 
      is slightly stretched, meaning that the ratio of each successive higher peak 
      increases by more than 1.0. Backus found that pipe resonances for C3 and C4 
      on the bassoon, for example, lay in a ratio of 1: 2.07 rather than a true harmonic 
      ratio of 1: 2.00.<a href="#note5"><font size="-1"><em>5</em></font></a> </p>
    <p>This stretching affects the intervals at which a bassoon fingering (in other 
      words, a pipe segment) can &#8211; after certain modifications &#8211; be made 
      to overblow. These overblown pitches, based on overtones (upper resonances) 
      of certain fingerings, are called the higher modal responses (or simply the 
      higher modes) of the bassoon. Fig. 2 shows the modal responses most commonly 
      used to produce the bassoon&#8217;s range.</p>
    <p align="center"><img id="fig2" src="images/harmonic/Fig2.gif"></p>
    <p align="center"><em>Figure 2. Pipe-resonance modes commonly used for standard 
      bassoon fingerings.</em></p>
    <p>Sometimes a given pitch of the bassoon can be obtained by use of either of 
      two modes (requiring two different fingerings, of course). The standard fingering 
      of C#4, for example, is a second-mode response, while the long fingering for 
      the same pitch is a third-mode response. The higher a given pitch, the greater 
      the chance that it can be produced in more than one mode. In this sense, mode 
      is not quite synonymous with &#8220;register.&#8221; </p>
    <p>Certain first-mode fingerings &#8211; F2 through D3 &#8211; are the bases or 
      ancestors, as Benade called them, of common higher-mode fingerings.<a href="#note6"><font size="-1"><em>6</em></font></a> 
      The third, fourth, and fifth modes of these ancestors are increasingly stretched 
      in frequency. The third mode (normally employed for Eb4 to A4) response is roughly 
      one semitone sharp of a harmonic ratio. The fourth mode (normally employed for 
      Bb4 through Eb5) response is one to two semitones sharp of a harmonic ratio. 
      The fifth mode, employed for so-called &#8220;harmonic&#8221; E5 (fingered without 
      use of a high E key) and above is, ironically, still further sharp of a harmonic 
      ratio. (We will postpone detailed discussion of higher-mode fingerings to the 
      appendix of this article. The reader with little appetite for the underlying 
      theory of these fingerings may wish to skip ahead.) </p>
    <p>One curiosity of the bassoon&#8217;s fingering technique is that the second 
      mode pitches (normally used for F#3 through D4) sound essentially in tune, despite 
      the stretched ratios of the pipe resonances. This welcome exception to the stretching 
      rule allows second-mode fingerings on the bassoon to be closely parallel to 
      their first-mode ancestors. Possible explanations for the exception are offered 
      below. <br>
      <a href="#top">[Top] </a></p>
    <p><strong><font size="+1"><a name="section1"></a>1. The full system: bassoon, 
      reed, and player </font></strong><br>
      Pipe resonances leave their imprint on the bassoon&#8217;s performance technique 
      (in the derivations of upper-mode fingerings), while the reed and the player, 
      when added to complete the system, give rise to other important acoustical characteristics. 
      At this point in our discussion, words can become treacherous. For clarity, 
      we will begin to speak of both (1) pipe resonances and (2) full-system resonances, 
      which include the contributions of the reed and the player&#8217;s vocal tract. 
      Full-system resonances are the musical sounds that bassoonists produce and listeners 
      experience. </p>
    <p>The audible spectrum of any full-system resonance of the bassoon is harmonic 
      in character; its overtones will have whole-number ratios to the fundamental.<a href="#note7"><font size="-1"><em>7</em></font></a> 
      This remains true even if the fundamental is itself a non-harmonic upper mode 
      of a given pipe resonance (and fingering). A concrete example will help to clarify 
      this cumbersome statement of an important fact. The full-system spectrum of 
      Eb4 will include, besides the fundamental Eb4 (311 Hz), higher resonance peaks 
      (overtones) at Eb5 (2 x 311 = 622 Hz), Bb5 (3 x 311 = 932 Hz), Eb6 (4 x 311 
      = 1,244 Hz), G6 (5 x 311 = 1,568 Hz), Bb6 (6 x 311 = 1,864 Hz), etc.<a href="#note8"><font size="-1"><em>8</em></font></a> 
      It is a separate issue that the fundamental (Eb4) originates as a third-mode 
      pipe resonance of G2 (98 Hz). The frequency ratio of Eb4 to G2 is 311:98, or 
      3.17, a semitone above the true harmonic ratio of 3.00.<a href="#note9"><font size="-1"><em>9</em></font></a> 
      Thus it sounds as an augmented (stretched) twelfth above G2, not a perfect (harmonic) 
      twelfth. </p>
    <p>Let&#8217;s talk for a moment about tone quality (timbre). If a player attempts 
      to sound the same pitch at the same volume on the same bassoon using (a) a &#8220;bright&#8221; 
      reed, and then using (b) a &#8220;dark&#8221; reed, the resulting timbre will 
      differ. The difference heard by the listener will be due to the varied strengths 
      of the respective full-system resonance peaks (fundamental and overtones) between 
      one reed and the other. In other words, the amplitudes (strengths) of the respective 
      resonance peaks will vary between two reeds, even though their frequencies remain 
      unchanged. (This assumes that the two reeds play in tune with one another). 
      Likewise, if two players &#8211; an expert (c) and then a beginner (d), let 
      us say &#8211; sound the same pitch at the same volume on the same instrument 
      and reed, the audible results will again differ. The amplitudes of the resonance 
      peaks will of course differ, but this time the differences will stem from the 
      players&#8217; differently shaped vocal tracts (we include under this term the 
      entire embouchure and breathing mechanism). Finally, we can obtain a slight 
      contrast in timbre by having one player repeat the exercise using the same reed, 
      but two different bassoons (e and f). </p>
    <p>We can draw a useful conclusion from this exercise: variations in strengths 
      of resonance peaks (differences in timbre) can arise from qualities of the reed 
      (<em>a versus b</em>), from qualities of the player&#8217;s vocal tract (<em>c 
      versus d</em>), or from qualities of the pipe itself (<em>e versus f</em>). 
      Now we are in a position to examine a second influence of the pipe&#8217;s resonances 
      on the full-system resonances the player obtains. <br>
      <a href="#top">[Top] </a> </p>
    <p><font size="+1"><strong><a name="section2"></a>2. What resonances are available? 
      </strong></font><br>
      Fig. 3a shows the pipe resonances for Bb1. The numerals and markers below the 
      horizontal line are located at intervals of true harmonic ratios. The markers 
      above the line are, in contrast, aligned with the pipe-resonance peaks. We can 
      see that the pipe-resonance peaks do not align well with the harmonic ratio 
      markers. The higher pipe resonances of the bassoon grow increasingly sharp, 
      to an extent that that the eleventh pipe-resonance peak (non-harmonic) essentially 
      coincides with the twelfth full-system resonance peak (harmonic).<a href="#note10"><font size="-1"><em>10</em></font></a> 
      The acoustical result of this coincidence is that the eleventh pipe-resonance 
      peak reinforces the twelfth full-system resonance, while the second through 
      tenth pipe resonance peaks offer less, or little, or even no reinforcement to 
      other full-system resonances. </p>

      the bassoon. (Experimental conditions cause the fundamental to register sharp

      legend line) are increasingly sharp to the harmonic ratios (spaced below the 
      legend line, with numbers). In fact, the eleventh resonance peak coincides with 
      the harmonic ratio of twelve. After Backus 1977.</em></p>

      note of the bassoon. When the reed and player are added to the system, peaks 
      are located at true harmonic intervals. Graph by Leslie Ross.</em></p>
    <p>As fig. 3a shows, the seventh harmonic of Bb1 is most poorly aligned with any 
      pipe-resonance peak, followed by the sixth and eighth harmonics, followed by 
      the fifth and ninth harmonics. The fourth and tenth harmonics show partial alignment 
      with certain pipe-resonance peaks, while the second, third, and eleventh show 
      substantial alignment. This extensive alignment of resonance peaks with harmonic 
      ratios at relatively low frequencies is why Bb1 is noticeably rich in overtones. 
    </p>
    <p>But such is not always the case. Backus gave striking examples of how little 
      the pipe sometimes contributes to the full-system resonance of some tones: </p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p>For the note F3, just before the break [open F, highest note of the first 
        mode], there is only one strong resonance, giving the fundamental; the resonance 
        curve for this note is shown in Fig. [4a]. As can be seen from this curve 
        all of the higher resonances are small, and their frequencies do not coincide 
        with the harmonic frequencies [that is, the resonance frequencies are sharp]....</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p align="left">(See fig. 4a.) This is the main reason why open F sounds thin 
      in timbre, compared to some lower notes.</p>

    <p>Backus continued: </p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p>The second resonance is used for the notes up through D 4. The next note 
        Eb4 is obtained by cross fingering; the vent hole thus provided reduces the 
        heights of the first two resonances and encourages the instrument to vibrate 
        on the third resonance [of the pipe] .... [See fig. 5a.] There are no resonances 
        so placed as to reinforce the higher harmonics. This is typical of the highest 
        notes on the instrument; if a resonance coincides with a harmonic above the 
        fundamental, it does so only by chance.<a href="#note11"><font size="-1"><em>11</em></font></a></p>

      strong pipe resonances align with the harmonic ratios of Eb4 (marked as 2 and 
      3). After Backus 1977. </em></p>

    <p><br>
      We may pursue Backus&#8217;s thought a little further to a useful conclusion. 
      The bassoon is played using its first five modes. Within these bounds, we may 
      say that the higher the mode number, the weaker the reinforcement of lower harmonics 
      by the pipe resonances will be. (Recall the progressively greater misalignment 
      of lower harmonics with the pipe-resonance peaks of Bb1.) In this sense, the 
      stretching of the pipe-resonance frequency ratio is directly responsible for 
      the thinner timbre in the bassoon&#8217;s upper modes. </p>
    <p>Now let&#8217;s compare the corresponding graphs of full-system resonances. 
      (See figs. 3b, 4b, 5b.) For each of the three notes graphed by Backus, we now 
      see an array of many strong resonances, each peak lying at a predictable, harmonic 
      ratio from the fundamental. If not from the pipe, where do these second and 
      higher peaks come from? The answer is, they come from the other components of 
      the bassoon&#8217;s acoustic system &#8211; the reed and the player. Both the 
      reed and the player&#8217;s vocal tract have a wide range of resonances available 
      to contribute to the system. For any sounding pitch, some of these resonances 
      enter into systematic collaboration with the pipe to produce a musical tone, 
      and the result is what acoustic physicists call a regime of oscillation. </p>
    <p>The regime is less tidy than the picture sometimes painted for pedagogical 
      purposes. It resembles to some extent an invisible game of musical chairs, in 
      particular one where the rules have been altered. In this altered game, which 
      we might call &#8220;harmonic chairs,&#8221; the chairs are arranged in a pattern 
      of harmonic relationships, although the absolute pitch levels are not predetermined. 
      After a fingering is chosen and the music starts (remember, the rules have been 
      altered), all available resonances scramble to find chairs. The strongest and 
      most harmonically attractive resonances that are available grab seats in a few 
      milliseconds, and the absolute pitches settle at whatever is the most stable 
      regime of oscillation. (It&#8217;s helpful to note that resonance peaks often 
      have broad bases covering a range of frequencies on either side of the peak 
      itself, as shown in figures 4b and 5b. Thus there is often some negotiability 
      in setting up the regime of oscillation. But the further off-peak, the weaker 
      the resulting harmonic will be.) </p>
    <p>This does not necessarily mean that the lowest resonance gets the most comfortable 
      chair; it may be forced into a chair that&#8217;s a little sharper or flatter 
      than it would prefer. If the lowest available resonance is harmonically unrelated, 
      it will get no chair at all. In other words, it (like other available resonances) 
      may not participate in a particular regime of oscillation. But once the player 
      changes to a different fingering, it&#8217;s time for a new regime of oscillation 
      and a new game of harmonic chairs.<a href="#note12"><font size="-1"><em>12</em></font></a> 
    </p>
    <p>As a participant in these regimes, a superior instrument, reed, or player will 
      make its/his/her excellence felt. Totally aside from the stretched ratio we 
      discussed above, the further alignment of pipe resonances in individual bassoons 
      can range from excellent to poor, giving rise to a corresponding range of tonal 
      beauty, or lack thereof. The &#8220;best&#8221; bassoon for a player will be 
      the one that, through well-aligned resonances and maximum flexibility, makes 
      the largest contributions to the hundreds or thousands of different regimes 
      that must arise during the performance of a musical work. Much the same is true 
      for the &#8220;best&#8221; reed, which has to contribute a range of appropriate 
      resonances even while its shape and size are changed by vibrations and by the 
      player&#8217;s embouchure. Different players will contribute different resonances 
      according to the differing shapes of their vocal tracts. But this is neither 
      the only edge the superior player can have, nor the most important one. Audibly 
      superior tone results when a player is able &#8211; consciously or unconsciously 
      &#8211; to adjust his/her embouchure for stronger resonance, and for a broader 
      range of resonant frequencies, the better to accommodate the exact pitch required 
      by an ensemble at a given moment. The superior player can optimize resonance 
      at extreme dynamic levels, at quick speeds of execution and, at times, while 
      in the throes of muscle fatigue. A &#8220;great sound&#8221; on the bassoon 
      is always achieved through a strong regime of oscillation. <br>

    <p><strong><font size="+1"><a name="section3"></a>3. The bassoon&#8217;s in-tune 
      second mode: how can this be? </font></strong><br>
      We noted earlier that the bassoon&#8217;s full-system, second-mode response 
      is essentially in tune &#8211; it overblows at a harmonic ratio of 2:1. How 
      does this happen, given that the pipe resonances are stretched? Part of the 
      answer lies in the small degree of stretching that would be expected in the 
      second mode. Given that the bassoon&#8217;s third- mode response is one semitone 
      sharp of harmonic, we might suppose that the second-mode stretching would be 
      less. Backus&#8217;s findings support this guess.<a href="#note13"><font size="-1"><em>13</em></font></a> 
    </p>
    <p>A second part of the answer may result from a trait of any woodwind&#8217;s 
      acoustical system called the cutoff frequency. The cutoff is a frequency above 
      which all the tone holes left open in a given fingering begin to participate 
      in the standing wave (the basic musical vibration of the bassoon or other woodwind). 
      This sounds at first like a rather remote concern to the performing bassoonist, 
      but such is not the case. What&#8217;s significant is that the full-system resonances 
      are boosted in strength &#8211; but lowered in frequency &#8211; in the proportion 
      by which they exceed cutoff frequency. This is because higher-frequency vibrations, 
      being increasingly shorter in wavelength, are more and more able to reach into 
      the open tone holes. Thus the open tone holes increasingly become part of the 
      vibrating air column. </p>
    <p>Experts sometimes describe the bassoon&#8217;s cutoff frequency as a range, 
      and other times as a single frequency. It has been reported as broadly as &#8220;300 
      Hz to 600 Hz&#8221; (that is about D4 to D5) or as narrowly as &#8220;about 
      400 Hz&#8221; (a little above G4 = 392 Hz).<a href="#note14"><font size="-1"><em>14</em></font></a> 
      Under any of these interpretations, however, the general effects are not in 
      question. In the following discussion, we will assume that cutoff frequency 
      is around 400 Hz. </p>
    <p>The higher the vibration frequency lies above cutoff, the more completely the 
      &#8220;tails&#8221; of the air column reach into the open tone holes. As they 
      do so, the volume of the tone holes is added to the main bore volume, and the 
      bore is effectively enlarged. This enlargement results, as might be expected, 
      in a flattening of the higher overtones, as compared to the fundamental. The 
      spectrum of the full-system peaks is therefore described as compressed. This 
      compression of the resonance frequencies above cutoff can flatten an entire 
      regime of oscillation.<a href="#note15"><font size="-1"><em>15</em></font></a> 
    </p>
    <p>With these unquestioned aspects of the bassoon&#8217;s acoustical behavior 
      in mind, we can now put forth an educated guess about the intonation of the 
      bassoon&#8217;s second mode. It may not be mere coincidence that virtually all 
      the overtones of the bassoon&#8217;s second- and higher-mode tones lie above 
      cutoff (whereas Bb1, in contrast, has five overtones below cutoff). The frequency 
      compression of the full system&#8217;s overtones above cutoff may help to balance 
      the stretching of the pipe resonances, as the sharp fundamentals of the second-mode 
      pipe resonances are lowered in regimes of oscillation dominated by flattened 
      overtones. In time, acoustics researchers may devise experiments to test this 
      hypothesis. </p>
    <p>We&#8217;ve been speaking of the bassoon&#8217;s second mode as if it were 
      perfectly in tune. For some fortunate players and/or instruments, this is true. 
      It is not uncommon, however, for the exact pitch and/or resonance of the notes 
      A3, Bb3, B3, C4 and D4 to require tweaking through bocal choice, reed design, 
      or the player&#8217;s embouchure.<a href="#note16"><font size="-1"><em>16</em></font></a> 
      Some players resort to more elaborate fingerings, such as holding open a secondary 
      speaker (&#8220;flick&#8221;) key, etc. Meanwhile, C#4 is also flat on some 
      bassoons. A common remedy is the use of well-known &#8220;long&#8221; or &#8220;full&#8221; 
      fingerings, which raise the pitch (by a shift into third mode). This well-known 
      range of remedies suggests that a precisely harmonic second mode is not a given, 
      even when the corresponding first-mode pitches are well in tune. The problem 
      may result from imprecise bore perturbations (sometimes including a poorly chosen 
      bocal), from more-than-optimal compression of overtones above cutoff (as described 
      above) in some individual bassoons, or from still other factors.<a href="#note17"><font size="-1"><em>17</em></font></a>

    <p><strong><font size="+1"><a name="section4"></a>4. The first and second modes 
      of response </font></strong><br>
      The lowest 19 semitones of the bassoon&#8217;s scale (Bb1 through F3) are obtained 
      as fundamentals of a gradually shortened pipe. (We are speaking here of the 
      modern Heckel or German system, including whisper key.) The higher pitches are 
      obtained by overblowing &#8211; by inhibiting production of the pipe&#8217;s 
      lower resonance(s), so that a higher resonance is heard as the sounding pitch. 
      This is accomplished by altering the frequency of the first- mode peak so that 
      it no longer fits into the harmonic regime of oscillation.<a href="#note18"><font size="-1"><em>18 
      </em></font></a>As bassoonists know, the second mode (or register) is produced 
      as octaves of the first mode. Benade referred to such first-mode fingerings, 
      the bases of higher-mode fingerings, as ancestors.<a href="#note19"><font size="-1"><em>19</em></font></a> 
    </p>
    <p>Small differences separate second-mode fingerings from their ancestors. To 
      produce F#3, we partially open the first finger hole. This makes the upper octave 
      speak securely, but it also has a side effect: it slightly sharpens the pitch. 
      A brief experiment will clarify this: attack and sustain F#3 while gradually 
      closing the half hole. Its volume will diminish, and the pitch will sag. If 
      we repeat the experiment with a simple fingering for G3 (/xx xxx), we get a 
      similar result. But if we then add the Eb key (a common remedy for a sharp G3), 
      we find that the size of the &#8220;half-hole&#8221; opening matters little.<a href="#note20"><font size="-1"><em>20</em></font></a> 
    </p>
    <p>The register-key vent, in contrast to use of a half-hole, does not cause appreciable 
      sharpening. Backus&#8217;s explanation for the clarinet&#8217;s register-key 
      vent is also valid for the bassoon&#8217;s whisper-key vent: </p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p>This hole essentially destroys the lowest resonance.... The lowest resonance 
        moves from its position as shown by the solid line ... to that shown by the 
        dotted line when the vent-hole is opened; the remaining higher resonances 
        are essentially unchanged.)<a href="#note21"><font size="-1"><em>21</em></font></a> 
        [See fig. 6.] </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>After the frequency of the lowest resonance has been shifted, the lowest resonance 
      is unable to participate in the regime of oscillation. The regime is instead 
      based on the next-higher mode, the bassoon&#8217;s second or the clarinet&#8217;s 
      third.</p>

      <strong><font size="+1"><a name="section5"></a>5. Effects of the stretched resonance 
      curve: Third and higher modes of the bassoon </font></strong><br>
      It&#8217;s not hard to recognize relationships between second-mode fingerings 
      of the bassoon and their first-mode ancestors. Bassoonists who double on clarinet 
      have no doubt grasped the ancestral relationship between some of the clarinet&#8217;s 
      third-mode fingerings (written B4 to C5) and their first-mode ancestors (written 
      E3 to G2). But fingerings for the bassoon&#8217;s third mode (Eb4 through A4) 
      are less obviously related to their ancestors.<a href="#note22"><font size="-1"><em>22</em></font></a> 
      The root cause of the obscurity is the stretched resonance curve of the bassoon&#8217;s 
      pipe resonances, as discussed above. Because of this stretching, standard bassoon 
      fingerings have to be based on an odd-looking but right-sounding interval. Even 
      under this &#8220;offset&#8221; scheme, ancestral relationships are further 
      obscured, at first glance, by the opening of various tone holes as cross-finger 
      vents. At second glance, however, the siting of these cross-finger vents in 
      fact follows roughly predictable patterns. Each new cross-finger vent in the 
      table is incrementally higher, tracing in miniature the rise of the sounding 
      pitches. After a simple pattern in mode 2, a new pattern is initiated in modes 
      3 and 4. (See fig. 7.) <br>

    </p>
    <p>The opening of cross-finger vents often has the additional effect of further 
      sharpening an already sharper- than-harmonic, third- or fourth-mode resonance. 
      The resulting sharpness is sometimes negligible, but at other times it is a 
      matter of a semitone. For fine-tuning of these and other intonation problems, 
      tone holes (often much further down the bore) are closed or opened. Still other 
      tone holes may be closed to enhance resonance. Examples include the addition 
      of the F key to the pitch G3 and the addition of the Eb key to the pitches E4 
      through A4. These fingering needs make ancestral relationships still harder 
      to discern. (See fig. 8.) </p>

      Third-mode response of the bassoon is one semitone sharp of a harmonic ratio, 
      after sharpness due to cross-finger venting is included. Eb3 marks the lowest 
      standard fingering of the third mode, but some lower alternate fingerings from 
      the mode are frequently employed, including the long C4.<a href="#note23"><font size="-1"><em>23</em></font></a>

    <p>Fourth mode is based on a narrower range of ancestors &#8211; from A2 to C#3. 
      B4 and B4 are one semitone sharp of a harmonic ratio, while C5 and higher are 
      two semitones sharp. (Again, part of this sharpness is due to the sharpening 
      effects of some cross-finger vents.) (See fig. 10.) The fourth mode traditionally 
      extends through &#8220;harmonic&#8221; D#5. However, certain left-hand keys, 
      if present, may be used to obtain a different D#5, and even E5 and F5, all of 
      these being sharpened versions of the D5 fingering. Fingered thus, all of these 
      are in fourth mode. </p>

    <p>The bassoon&#8217;s fifth mode begins at &#8220;harmonic&#8221; E5, using fingerings 
      that may be consulted on the web site http://www.idrs.org/bsnfing/fingnote.htm. 
      The numerous available fingerings for the fifth mode are more difficult to analyze 
      with certainty, due to increasing complications and the increasing sharpness 
      of the ancestral resonance peaks. For example, is E5 the quadruple-augmented 
      seventeenth of G2, as one fingering would imply? Or is it the triple-augmented 
      seventeenth of G2, as another fingering would imply? (See fig. 11.) </p>

    <p align="center"><em>Figure 11. Two fifth-mode fingerings for E5. These two sample 
      fingerings show that a single pitch can have fingerings based on different ancestors, 
      even within the same mode. Fingerings based on Ewell. </em></p>
    <p>At the borders between modes, a relatively open lower-mode fingering will be 
      neighbor to a relatively closed higher-mode fingering. During an ascending slur 
      to the higher mode, a mildly percussive white noise is an audible clue that 
      mode shifting is at work. This rough transition makes for some crunchy trills 
      between such neighbors as F3/F#3, D4/Eb4, A4/ Bb4, and &#8220;harmonic&#8221; 
      D#5/E5. </p>
    <p>Mode shifts also make for treacherous longer slurs, especially slurs downward 
      to a lower mode. A bassoon passage in the Tchaikovsky Fifth Symphony, third 
      movement, provides a well-known example. (See fig. 12.) Four downward slurs 
      between third- and second-mode pitches precede a second- to first-mode slur. 
      In the absence of a tongued articulation, the player often uses a speaker key 
      to assure the mode shift. The player may also use the embouchure, wind velocity, 
      and well-designed, flexible reeds to help minimize this difficulty. </p>

      through seventh measures indicate the modes of the respective fingerings. This

    <p>The structural sharpness of higher-mode responses of the bassoon is seldom 
      questioned by its long-suffering players, who patiently learn the bizarre-looking 
      fingerings by rote. It may provide some practical guidance, however, and it 
      certainly provides some moral support, to know that there is a method to the 
      seeming madness of these fingerings.</p>

      the pitch-ratio discrepancy between pipe resonances and full-system resonances 
      in print, although he would surely have been aware of it. The following statement 
      neglects the issue: &#8220;The actual playing frequencies of a reed instrument 
      are therefore approximately the same as the resonance frequencies measured for 
      the air column with the reed end closed [the pipe, that is], and thus correspond 
      to the high impedance peaks for the input impedance curves. The intonation of 
      a given instrument will then depend critically on the frequencies of the impedance 
      peaks.&#8221; Backus 1974: 1266. </p>
    <p><strong>11</strong> <a name="note11"></a>Backus 1977: 243-45. </p>
    <p><strong>12</strong> <a name="note12"></a>This interaction is explained more 
      technically in a theory called interlocking or mode locking. See Benade 1990: 
      445; Fletcher and Rossing 1991: 143-44. Multiphonic tones are an exception to 
      this scheme; see Backus 1977: 250-51 and Benade 1990: 565-55, for an introduction. 
    </p>
    <p><strong>13</strong> <a name="note13"></a>Backus 1974: 1274-75. </p>
    <p><strong>14</strong> <a name="note14"></a>&#8220;[Benade&#8217;s] measurements 
      show that musically satisfactory instruments have cutoff frequencies within 
      the range ... 300-600 Hz for bassoons.&#8221; Fletcher and Rossing 1991: 476. 
      This statement seems to be a liberal interpretation of Benade 1990: 487-88, 
      fig. 22.8, where a graph shows cutoff frequencies for baroque, Buffet, and Heckel-type 
      bassoons. The range shown for Heckel 7170, most appropriate to our discussion, 
      appears to extend from about 380 Hz to 520 Hz. Meanwhile, Cronin 1996: 24 found 
      that &#8220;The bassoon&#8217;s cutoff frequency is about 400 Hz over most of 
      the range of the instrument.&#8221; </p>
    <p><strong>15</strong> <a name="note15"></a>Benade remarked on the potency of 
      the overtone compression: &#8220;... an air column provided with open tone holes 
      &#8216;looks&#8217; longer when it is asked to vibrate in a high-frequency mode 
      than it does when it is vibrating in a lower-frequency mode. On woodwinds, this 
      phenomenon by itself accounts for a flattening of any upper resonance frequency 
      relative to the lowest one. This flattening (which can amount to an appreciable 
      fraction of a semitone) may need to be offset by alterations in the bore profile 
      when the instrument is adjusted to play properly.&#8221; Benade 1991: 432-33. 
    </p>
    <p><strong>16</strong> <a name="note16"></a>Corey 1980: 30-32 found these pitches 
      to be &#8220;often flat&#8221; or &#8220;almost always flat.&#8221; </p>
    <p><strong>17</strong> <a name="note17"></a>See Nederveen 1998: 90-91 for a technical 
      discussion of the effects of closed key holes and bore perturbations. </p>
    <p><strong>18</strong> <a name="note18"></a>Cronin 1996: 23 described the production 
      of the third and higher modes: &#8220;The effect [of cross-fingerings] is to 
      misalign the lower air-column resonances while strengthening the third, fourth 
      or fifth resonance so that a high note is produced.&#8221; He drew a distinction 
      between cross fingerings and half-hole fingerings, writing that &#8220;small 
      vents opened to facilitate octave overblowing are not considered tone holes 
      in this definition.&#8221; Yet the half-hole can at times have the effect of 
      sharpening the second-mode response, just as the cross- finger vent sharpens 
      the higher-mode responses. </p>
    <p><strong>19</strong> <a name="note19"></a>Benade 1960: 224. </p>
    <p><strong>20</strong> <a name="note20"></a>The particular sharpness of G3 is 
      a complicated matter outside the scope of our discussion. See Cronin 1996: 26 
      for a detailed explanation. </p>
    <p><strong>21</strong> <a name="note21"></a>Backus 1977: 228. For further comments, 
      see Benade 1990: 455. </p>
    <p><strong>22</strong> <a name="note22"></a>Baines wrote that &#8220;the high 
      register of the bassoon is obtained by sharp-sounding harmonics that almost 
      defy analysis.&#8221; These sharp resonances are not harmonics, to speak precisely, 
      but we understand that Baines was describing the stretched resonance curve. 
      He continued, &#8220;To give two of the less mystifying examples, A4 and E5 
      on the German model are made as third and fourth harmonics of low-register C#3 
      (theoretically G#4 and C#5 respectively).&#8221; Baines 1991: 38. </p>
    <p><strong>23</strong> <a name="note23"></a>&#8220;The various &#8216;long fingerings&#8217; 
      for C#4 are also cross-fingerings.&#8221; Cronin 1996: 23.</p>
